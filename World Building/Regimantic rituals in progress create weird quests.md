___
This one is self explanatory, but either carrying out or interfering with the steps of regimantic rituals can lead to some weird and interesting quests. Perhaps the prince must be guarded, but only until the solstice. After that, his assassins must be allowed to succeed. Or perhaps an _enemy_ figure of note must be _protected_ from allied military action, because his death will move the enemy ritual further along.
