# R1-01 - Ruined Patio
*See also:* L1-01
___

Grand staircases (2, white marble, heavily cracked, leads
to [[R2 Bathhouse Ruins - Second Floor]]),

three wide archways (20’ high, 80’ wide, high ceilings, glass shards, leads to the [[R1-02 Atrium]]), force field [deep blue, eastern
half only, blocks all light and passage], debris [basalt slabs,
rubble, vines, and thin pale roots], party noises [music,
laughter, eastern grand staircase]

The force fields are locked on the right side of the patio,
but are disabled on the left side. Wide archways between
the grand staircases open up into the cavernous building,
but the sounds of a party can be heard only from the
eastern staircase. Pale roots and fallen debris block
access to the right wing of the patio, but can be climbed.

There may be an entrance on the east side to the [[R1-07 Swirling Lake]].

There may be an opening to the west to the [[R1-001 Terrace]].
