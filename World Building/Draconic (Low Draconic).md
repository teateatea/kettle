# Draconic (Low Draconic)
When dragons speak to lesser beings (meaning non-deity, non-dragon), they generally use Low Draconic. Most mortals are not aware of this distinction, and simply call this language "Draconic" when they speak it.

> *You speak as peasants speak, little insect. Lowly, and without elegance.*

[[Torian Wizards|Wizard]] names are usually in Draconic (Latin), because the language is very enduring, and remains legible across thousands of years. Wizards like being recognizeable for thousands of years lol.
