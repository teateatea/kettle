### OSE p.15

Combine steps 5, 6, and 7, so as to note Hit Dice, Attack Bonus, Saves, and Abilities all at once. We might as well while we're looking at the character sheet.

7.  Roll Hit Points: Add "1st level characters automatically roll the highest possible value on their hit dice to determine their Maximum HP. Additionally, determine your Life Points (LP) now: LP = Constitution score x 10"
    
8.  Choose Alignment: Entire section removed. This style of alignment will not be a feature in my games. Behave as you wish and reap the fruits of your labour.
    
9.  Note Known Languages: Entire section removed. This will be re-added into the level up procedure, to ensure languages have practical application.
    
10.  Buy Equipment: *Add gold conversion rates here. *Consider allowing max buy
    
11.  Name Character: Add "Roll on Appearance tables". For Hot Springs Island, roll 3d20 and combine the digits to determine your debts to the Martel Company. If you roll 3, 17, and 16, you owe them 31,716 gold pieces. This likely includes your equipment fees.
