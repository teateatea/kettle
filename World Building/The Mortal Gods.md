# The Mortal Gods
*See also:* 
___
The Gods of Mortals govern all things experienced by mortals, and are most commonly worshiped in Caspia. While each is known by a single Caspian word-name, their jurisdictions span a range of emotion and experience, and can be both positive and negative.

##### Translator's Note
Caspian prose is able to write phonetically identical words with different meanings, but not all languages have this poetic ability. For use in non-Caspian translations, the convention is to use the word-name followed by a descriptor that closely describes the intended interpretation: SHO(faith) vs SHO(admiration) vs SHO(submission). Each of these would be pronounced /Êƒo/ or "show" when spoken aloud.
___
Their strengths ebb and flow with civilization, and the interpretation of their will can be highly varied. Even in regions where they should be at their strongest, they are fickle. As such, they're sometimes called the Wandering Gods when compared to the Natural Gods.

War, for example, could easily be interpreted as the hands of RAI(ecstasy), SHO(submission), EL(submission), EL(terror), HET(surprise), VO(grief), TIF(loathing), KOA(rage), or MET(vigilance), depending on perspective. 

The Mortal Gods were manifested through the combined experience of living things, and as such cannot be directly destroyed. Their will is weakest or nonexistent where there are no living things experiencing their domain, so there are likely planes they cannot access (dead planes, fearless planes, trustless planes, joyless planes). To actually kill them, one would need to destroy all living things across all planes that are capable of experiencing their domain.
