Maestros are adventurers whose study of the world has taught them how to cast spells. Maestros are able to cast a greater number of increasingly powerful spells as they advance in arcane ability.

## Maroi's Perspective on Maestros
Maroians call the Caspian Maestro a [[Sorcerers|sorcerer]], "someone who intuits magic from within". They see a Maestro casting magic, and never see a spellbook, so they assume there have been no studies (or at least not the research type in a library). Maestros find this mildly annoying, as their craft is *very* finely honed, and sorcerer implies a lack of knowledge, design, and control.

It's like calling an orchestra a coincidence. *No, this whole performance was actually incredibly complicated to coordinate actually.*

It's like calling ballet (improve dance what's that called), sure it's nice that some people want to just do a shitty random emotion dance, but I have been training hard for YEARS to do my thing exquisitely.

## Caspia
Maestros are people who conduct magic. They are generally from independent private schools, and may be commissioned by the state, but always keep their background as their highest priority.

# The Life-Path of Wae

You're a sorcerer! Your magic stems from the [[The Wae Sho - The Caspian Philosophy-Art|Life-Path of Wae (often shortened to just the Wae Sho).]] You've probably meditated and practiced under a [[Domino]] near [[The Yellow City|the Yellow City]].

**Learning Spells:** Requires spending time learning the forms, and normally learning the ins and outs of spell manipulation. Once learned, the spell is always accessible (barring memory loss), but regular review is a good idea. Roll Int.

**Moving/Transfering Spells:** Basically an entirely mundane process. Other magic users find spells you move/transfer to be... nearly unuseable or even unintelligible.

**Copying/Duplicating Spells:** Again, copying some writing is a mundane process. Copying spells you've seen performed by foreign magic users tends to fizzle, or misfire.

**Scrolls:** Pretty awkward. You'd be better off studying it before hand, sight-reading is hard.

---

**Binding Enchantments:** Lost knowledge and wildly time consuming. Something to do with meditating over items until it attunes to your will. You can use foreign artifacts at least.

**Inventing New Magic:** Possible. Requires time, doesn't always work. Modifying known spells to do slightly adjacent things isn't unreasonable. Producing both entirely new & highly effective results is uncommon except in the very skilled.

The Torian Wizards describes a strange relationship with the Weave. Their performances take the character of creatures and beasts, as though the magician is not entirely in control of his own magic.

And this appears to be the truth. The magician must "re-gather his flock" each morning if he wishes to perform magic again that day. He rarely learns how to cast a spell today though he cast it yesterday.

Despite this flaw, they do seem to have great affinity with spell manuals. They engage easily with any manual, and are prepared to cast them in only minutes, rather than with hours. They claim they let the spell do the work for them.

Note that master wizards seem to have a much higher mana limits than our sorcerers, likely due to that fact.

Maroi Wizards take the same easy-to-learn-easy-to-forget approach that the Torians do, but with an overly analytical stance instead. They approach spell performance as though it were made of numbers rather than actions. Some kind of complicated theoretical problem.

Interestingly, the wizard appears unconcerned with weave feedback when repeating identical spells. Outrider reports suggest that weave patterning in Maroi is becoming increasingly unpredictable, but this is somehow not affecting their work.

They're quite good at tinkering with artifacts, so do not discount them as an ally.
