___
**Scary situations:** Okay

**Horror situations:** Okay

**Panic attack situations:** Okay, but let's see how the first two go first.

**Mental health situations:** Let's stay classy here, but it's allowed on the table. Very aware that Anxiety disorders, Bipolar, Depression, etc etc exist in the real world. I'm trying to make these caves The Worst, but only for the characters not the players lol.

**Discuss whether losing control of** **characters** **is okay. Refer to Veins of the Earth Player Reference Page. There may be situations where they choose something like cannibalism, what if something mind-controlled them? What if something made them do worse? Fade-to-black, roleplay, etc?**
