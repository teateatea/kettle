# SIr Chyde's Sword
*See also:* [[Sir Chyde]], [[Fae]], [[Giants]], [[Swords]]
___
the sword with which he slew the fairy giant Butter-for-Bones

Needs a name!

With wavy blood grooves. The sword is enchanted (of fairy construction): +2 to hit and damage. It carries a glamour that affects mortals who wield it, compelling them to attack the largest foe in battle. (aka Butter-for-Bones)

▶ **The knight’s hand:** If the mould is cleared (**save versus poison**, see above), PCs see a longsword with wavy blood grooves, surrounded with a white glow.
