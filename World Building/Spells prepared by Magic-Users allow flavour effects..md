# Spells prepared by Magic-Users allow flavour effects.

Let [[Magic Users]] with prepared spells do minor flavour effects related to the spell they have prepared. This shows they have it in their mind, and [[Vancian Magic|have not yet forgotten it yet]].

For example:
- A wizard with Fireball prepared can light their pipe.
- Light prepared can make a (non-dazzling) flash.
- Dimension Door can reach across a room to grab the TV remote lol.

This basically eliminates the need for cantrips.
