___
[[Saint Acobi]] made a deal with [[The Dwarvish King]]: The Dwarves remain sovereign, but for each Free Dwarf, 12 slaves must be contributed to the cause. The deadline is in 12 years.

How many dwarves are there? At least 6,000 (dozenal, decimal: 10,000) . Meaning at least 59,540 slaves (120,000 slaves decimal) total

6,000 slaves per year. (10,000 decimal)

For context, African slaves were brought to the US at a rate of (VERY APPROXIMATELY ON AVERAGE) 35,190 decimal  (18,446 dozenal). About three times the rate of the Dwarven Slavery Debt.

As set by Saint Acobi, one dwarf counts for
12 men count for one dwarf.
