***GM Reminder: Puppies have plot armour.***

- [[Dogs]]
- [[Cats]]
- Small animals
- Babies of large animals

Specifically, cute non-sentient creatures, like dogs, cats, etc.

- *Non-cute* creatures are allowed to get hurt (plenty of non-cute monsters to fight lol).

- Cute but _sentient_ creatures are allowed to get hurt too (it's okay to kick a kid/kid-sized person-thing). [[Sabrina]] lol.

- **Cute non-sentient creatures are allowed to _not_ get hurt!**

- Cute animals can be *not-hurt-but-probably-not-happy* (aka the vampire decides he wants a pet cat so he kidnaps yours). *"This is fine, but we're getting that cat back" (and this may alter the course of the campaign lol)"*

[[Dogs are never killed.]]

**Recommend calling out if something becomes cute lmao, just in case? Like the way really ugly things can somehow also be cute.Â _"This giant leech now has plot armour!"_**
