# The Dreamscape
*See also:* [[Dreams, Visions, and Prophesies|Dreams]]
___
Exists between the [[The Spiritual Plane|Spiritual Plane]] and [[The Fae Wild]].

The main difference is how one enters the space. Dreaming vs otherwise.
> NB consider removing this and using the skill swaps from the Spiritual plane.
> ~~These ones could be used for the astral sea?~~

 In generally, use different ability scores while in the dreamscape:
- [[Constitution (Ability Score)|Constitution]]: Use ~~Wisdom Charisma~~ [[Intelligence (Ability Score)|Intelligence]] instead.
- [[Strength (Ability Score)|Strength]]: Use ~~Intelligence Wisdom~~ [[Charisma (Ability Score)|Charisma]] instead.
- [[Dexterity (Ability Score)|Dexterity]]: Use ~~Charisma intelligence~~ [[Wisdom (Ability Score)|Wisdom]] instead.
- Wisdom
- Intelligence
- Charisma

The intelligent people become tough. They know the damage isn't real.
The charismatic people become strong. Their personalities are a force of nature.
The wise people become quick. They move about easily, intuitively.


Size is generally related to INT and CHA.
Combat skill is generally related to CHA and WIS.

HP is set by INTELLIGENCE.
Movement is set by WISDOM.

Creatures that appear huge in the spiritual plane are instead incredibly strong here.
