## 4 [[Religious Animated Objects]]
**Standing on plinths** (in the corners of the room).
**Mouldy** (covered with mustard-coloured fur).

▶ **Items:** All about 1’ tall.
- A silver crucifix (200gp), 
- a wooden statue of a cherub, 
- a holy book, 
- a huge candle.

▶ **Reaction:** If a non-Lawful character sets foot in the room, the objects float into the air and attack. (Lawful as defined by how well they maintain their blades. Oiled, sharpened, stropped, hilt wrapped, etc.)

- **Scolding:** When animated, the objects speak in a shrill, sanctimonious tone, scolding PCs for their misdeeds (including entering the tomb).
- **When killed:** A cloud of mould spores erupts. **Anyone in melee: save vs poison,** or suffer 1d2 damage and choke for 1 round (cannot act)
