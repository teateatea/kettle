# The Death of the Phandals
*See also:* [[The Phandals]], [[Dwarves MOC]]

## ['ʃlɪʁə an 'tʃʲɛnə]

800 years ago, [[Dwarves MOC]] opened the [[Dwarven Portal to Chaos and Fire]] [[Shattered Canyons]], a portal to [[The Plane of Chaos]]. [[Demons]] poured forth, and [[Heat-Seeking Demons|these demons sought ]] *[[Heat-Seeking Demons|heat]]* [[Heat-Seeking Demons|specifically]].

Well, the nearest hottest source of heat is [[The Phandalin Volcano]]. The [[Heat-Seeking Demons]] immediately cursed [[Phandalin Capital]], and the [[Weeping Wastes]] around it to burn any seeds, then proceeded to rampage through [[The Phandals]] to [[The Phandalin Volcano]].

What threat from the Phandals drove the Dwarves to this nuclear bomb?

## Dwarvish Reception
This is event  incredibly unpopular amongst [[Zen Dwarves]], akin to the American nuclear bombing. A source of shame. They weren't there to see the threat.
