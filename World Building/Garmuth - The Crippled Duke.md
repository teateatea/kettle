### The Shrine of Garmuth

*Foes Shall Deflect Attacks on A Whim*

### Design Notes
**Icon of Garmuth:** A cracked mirror, shards of mirror.
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once an attack has been reflected.

The first attack made by the party is always automatically deflected.

Attacks against the enemy have an L-in-6 chance of being deflected, automatically missing. Critical hits cannot be deflected, and immediately break the mirror icon.

Allies may focus on a destination, and are drawn towards a cardinal direction that will accurately bring them towards it.
