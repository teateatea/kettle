# Cassius Crow (Orilo Ithino)

### *"I'm going to piss on your ashes."*

#### Appearance
A hulking goliath, blue-skinned with writhing tattoos snaking across his upper body. He's wearing leather bracers, boots, and a leather kilt over his weathered pants. Sometimes he'll wear an armoured vest, but not usually.

#### Roleplay
* Snooty, narcissistic, spoiled and generally insufferable
* Move slowly and heavily; lots of stability
* Speak from the back of the throat
* Slight american sergeant accent

#### Background
Cassius Crow is now the vicious Commander of the Laughing Skulls, running the gang with brutality and oppression. Some say he just enjoys the power, but Cassius is goal driven beyond senseless violence.

#### Connections
* **Cassius** is Maxilla of the **Laughing Skulls**, second only to the **Laughing Queen** herself.
* **Cassius** oversees **Skint's** work at the **Chesterfeld** docks, where they ship stolen goods.
* **Cassius** hates the **Iron Shepherds**, and wants their spreading influence destroyed.

#### Dark Secret
Cassius came from a long line of master smiths, and is the first to have failed. His tribe was captured and slaughtered by the Iron Shepherds, and he's looking for a way to avenge his people.

#### Plot Hooks
- The **Iron Shepherds** have been moving southwards since

# Assorted Meetings

##
- Malira Guard, no words passed but he would have seen them after they helped with the Malira Priest mugging.
- Three different Eternal Host Guards at the Western Gates of Millburn. One of them overcharged Bill for entry, but Bill didn't notice.
- 4 Guys playing cards in the Beveridge Brew. One of them had 2 rings on his left ear.
- Black Hand Guard at the Millburn Barracks. Got tipped for apparently minor gossip, likes Monty. Doesn't know his name.
- Kidd's Magical Rock Store.
