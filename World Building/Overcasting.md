___
## [[Torian Wizards]]
Basically impossible. How would you produce anima from nothing!?

## [[Maroian Magicians]]
Wildly dangerous, but possible. The mental shapes required are highly complex, and have been researched and categorized.

Producing the exact result is unlikely. This is only a concern to those who wish for their magic to be *reliable*. Those unconcerned with variability in their magic will find the [[The Weave|Weave]] surprisingly forgiving when the bar is lowered to "I got the job done" and "collateral damage is irrelevant."
