In the ruins, a magnificent statue of a marid in a geyser
produces scalding water for the pool. It wears a tiara
encrusted with 5 glittering sapphires. Touching it will
allow anyone to speak telepathically to the half-marid
imprisoned inside. Her speech is mad and all over the
place. She begs to be freed, and points to the eastern
staircase. If asked to free someone from the illusion, she
will accept at the condition of taking an oath to come
back within a week to free her. Breaking the promise will
curse you to sink like an anchor when in any body of
water. A half-marid is also present on the Frieze here.
