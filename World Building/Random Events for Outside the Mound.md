*See also:* [[Random Events]]
___
## Random Events
*(1-in-6 chance every two turns)*
1. A PC suddenly spots a [[Petrifying Owl|ghostly, violet-eyed owl]] gazing down from a high branch. **Save versus spells** or fall into a faint for 1d6 turns.
2. 1d4 **[[tipsy goblin merchants]]** with lanterns climb cautiously out of a trapdoor in the forest floor. They have stepped into Dolmenwood from Fairy, seeking rare night-fruits. (**See [[Dolmenwood Goblin]], p20.**) 
3. A **gust of wind whips** the branches of the trees into a frenzy. PCs near trees must **save versus paralysis** or be struck for 1 damage. Flames sputter and may go out: torches 4-in-6 chance, lanterns 2-in-6.
4. A **huge, warty toad** creeps over, eyes the PCs quizzically, and utters a single, croaking word: “Betrayal”.
