___
> Seiðkona are most known for their ability to receive prophetic visions and to cast protective spells. Their spells can be used to aid in battle, to ward off malicious spirits and creatures or to simply ease the many hardships of everyday life.
>
> Seiðkona are predominately female (a Seiðkarl is a male mage).
> 
> They receive their magical powers from [[The Murian Pantheon]] (something like Freyja and Odinn).

# Spells
> Seiðkona spells are channelled through runes written, painted or carved in a ritualist manner. A rune of this nature is called a [[Galdrastafur]].

# Visions 
*See also:* [[Oracles]], [[Dreams, Visions, and Prophesies]]
Summoning visions of the future is one of the central skills of a Seiðkona. These prophetic visions are mainly reached through dreams.
