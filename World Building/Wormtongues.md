*See also:* [[Creatures MOC]], [[The Dolmenwood|Dolmenwood]]
___
**Squirming, tongue-like worms** (dark pink, bumpy).
**4’ long** (thigh-thick).
**Tooth-ringed mouths** (like lampreys).
**Eyeless** (attack by taste).
**Lurking** (tunnel by the collapsed wall.

▶ **Reaction:** Disturbed by noise in the room. Ravenously attack.

## Slime Trails
**Gooey** (like petroleum jelly).
**Opalescent** (largely transparent).

▶ **Tracking:** The trails lead from the hole into the woods and back. Characters
skilled with tracking can detect trails of three slug- or worm-like creatures.
▶ **Touching:** A slight acidity can be detected, if the slime is touched with bare flesh. (This is not enough to cause damage.)
