## Mana from the Soul
How much mana can you produce from your soul?

At low levels, this might only be a handful of mana. At more advanced levels, this can be tens of mana.

## Mana from the Sun
If the Maestro can see the sky, they might draw their power from daylight. They have a creed to each draw from the Sun only once per day, as any further is considered an affront to the [[Sun]].

##### Mana from the Moon
At advanced levels, Maestros can also draw mana from the [[Moon]]. Again, to avoid rudeness this is only done once per night.

## Mana from the Land
Maestros also draw power from the land. This is also limited to once per day, but per region. As a general rule, if you cast a spell from the land, you should walk far enough that you wouldn't hear a gunshot, some 300-500 meters depending on the terrain.



Take care however, not to create feedback from the weave by repeating spells.
