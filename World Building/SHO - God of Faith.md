Admiration, Trust, Acceptance

LOVE, SUBMISSION

Caspians believe that the Torian Saints are granted most of their power by SHO (and sometimes by other gods). It's the Torian faith in the Twelve that grants SHO strength, and with enough belief, their miracles can be performed. There are no qualms with that fact that Torians do not worship SHO: their faith alone is enough to empower him.

- SHO(submission) can grant power to those who rule through oppression.
