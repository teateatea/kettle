# R1-04 Dusty Bar
*See also:*
___
Bar [cool and dusty, cloudy bottles], hidden safe [roll for
treasure], scattered shards [crystal, colours change when
walked over], ceiling flowers [white, fragrant, dripping
nectar], staircase [down to basement [[RB - The Bathhouse Ruins (Basement)]]]

Cave lilies grow here now, quietly dripping nectar over
piles of shattered crystal. Catching a drop of nectar on
the tongue has a 1-in-10 chance of triggering a subtly
evil vision of the past or future.

East doorway to [[R1-03 Wide Hall]].
