### Dwarves are incredibly cagey about their reproduction.
They *really* don't like talking about how dwarves are made. Once, [[someone started stealing dwarf hearts]] which is akin to aliens rendering all humans sterile. *An existential crisis.*

### Dwarf Reproduction

[[Dwarf Hearts]] are found in the earth, generally in mountains.


Dwarves spend an inordinate amount of time hunting these down.

Dwarves are asexual. They choose their appearance, but the beards are obviously deeply cultural. [[Dwarvish Values|Dwarvish Culture values strength, stoicism, willpower, and resolve,]] and carve their appearance to match their preferences. To [[The Race of Men MOC]], about 2/3 of dwarves present as outwardly male, and the last 1/3 present as female with beards or neutral with beards. They are really just aiming for strong (thick arms), strong constitions and resolve (sturdy bodies), and stoicism (slower, controlled, steady movements, not overly erratic or emotional). These qualities aren't actually gendered, but when you see all of them on a creature with a beard, it's the assumption with the least resistance. [[Dwarvish Language]] doesn't include gender at all, all things living or dead are neutral. When dwarves encounter other languages, they either choose neutral (most similar to their own language), or they encourage the use of whichever gender matches the traits they most prefer: In Common/Torian, that's male, but in Antling, it's female.


They are made of stone. They can carve new stone bodies, and then reach into their own bodies to pull out their [[Dwarf Hearts]], and place them into the new body. Their old body is a statue of themselves, with an arm reaching out.

[[Zen Dwarves]] eat their old bodies.
[[Remembering Dwarves]] store their old bodies in ancient halls to remember them by.
