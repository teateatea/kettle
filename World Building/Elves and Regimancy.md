# Elves and Regimancy
*See also:* [[Elvish Magic]]
___
Elves fucking hate the idea of Regimancy. It requires blundering, inelegant actions. It is almost always unnecessarily costly, or in the case of Elvish lives, *inexcuseably* costly. Elves are pretty happy to do things the long way.

They are aware of it however, and [[Elvish Spies]]' primary purpose is to observe for Regimancy.
