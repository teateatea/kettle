# The Twelve Patron Saints of Caelon
*See also:* [[Pantheons MOC]]
___
Torians follow the Twelve Saints, people whose exceptional accomplishments raised them to sainthood. While each of these people would have had followers in life, the domains associated with each saint have been chosen post-humously, based on their life's work and motivations. It's the loyalty even after death that grants a saint power; if enough people continuously call upon someone or act in their name, miracles can be granted.

Many of the dead are remembered by a few of their descendents, but widespread memories of these saints have endured the test of time. Farmers may ask for their ancestors blessings, but they also *always* honor Saint Marila as they seed their fields. Beggars always throw a coin for Saint Griselbrand, Scholars always toast to Saint Gilean.
