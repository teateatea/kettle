___
The [[Theory of Essencial Potential Energy]] defines spells as [[Essence|essencial energy]] formed into a potential shape. They are not conventional shapes, but highly complex four-dimensional shapes, which makes thinking about them in detail very difficult.

Generally, [[Maroian Magicians|Magicians]] prepare their spells by inducing a hallucination that lets them see the four dimensional shapes first, and only *then* can they begin to manipulate their [[Spell Slots (TEPE)|charges]] into the appropriate spellforms.

The spellforms kept in spellbooks help [[Spellforms (TEPE)|put your mind into the right trance to hold a transient mental geometry in your consciousness]] long enough to manipulate some essence to match it.
