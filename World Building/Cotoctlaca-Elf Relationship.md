## Halfling-Slave Relationship with the Elves
*See also:* [[Tlecomitlaca - The Free Halflings|Tlecomitlaca]]
___
The [[Elves MOC]] call [[Halflings Slave-Soldiers]] 'rhia,' or ('pikku paskaa' πίκκο πασκαα (Finnish-Greek)) meaning "little betrayers" (with the additional connotation of "little shits"). 

Elves were initially defending their [[Iron Groves]].
___

The [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|Cotoctlaca]] do not understand what the Elves are defending, and are annoyed that Elves are giving them the cold shoulder. Can we just talk for one second?
