Idk what the fuck they did, but they most certainly set him up. [[Acobi - The Chastened Maid]] is a [[Halfling MOC|Halfling]] god, *The Goddess of Oath and Abandon.* But they somehow set him up so that he would be powered up as if he were a god.

But he must abandon his people.

He's probably from [[Brynn (Village)]].
