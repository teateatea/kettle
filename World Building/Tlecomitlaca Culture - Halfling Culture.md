# Tlecomitlaca Culture
## Halfling Culture
*See also:* [[Halfling MOC]]
___
Halflings call themselves the *Tlecomitlaca* (literally, the [Hearth](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/tlecomitl)-[people](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/tlaca-0)). Their homeland is *Tlacoyoctli Tlecomitl* ("Kitchen Hearth"), now called [[The Ferncombe]], before they were taken as [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|slaves]] by [[The Race of Men MOC]] about 350-400 years ago.

It's been 6 halfling generations since then.

Most more fled south to [[The Breaker Plains]], and have continued their traditional culture spanning long centuries. This group still calls themselves the [[Tlecomitlaca - The Free Halflings|Tlecomitlaca]], and are divided roughly into the [[Elimicqui (Northern Halfling Famers)|Elimicqui (farmers in the north)]] and the [[Amini (Southern Halfling Hunters)|Amini (hunters in the south)]].

Many halflings were taken as slaves during the [[The Battle of the Hearth|The Slaughter of Tlecomitl]]. Their descendents, the [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|Cotoctlaca]] live in the [[Torwood]], as second-rate citizens in Tor. 

> This article concerns the Tlecomitlaca as a culture. For more information about the halflings separated from their kin, see [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor]].

*See also:* [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor]]

Most halflings encountered outside the Breaker Plains are [[Elimicqui (Northern Halfling Famers)|Elimicqui]], from the North. They are industrious when working, but prone to taking breaks when the mood strikes.

When [[Amini (Southern Halfling Hunters)]] are encountered beyond their borders, treat as Bull Fighters: Bravado, personality, risk takers, charismatic and aloof. A bit of a celebrity.

[[Mimichacini (Halfling Sailors)]] are shallow water fishers. Halflings are generally not found far from their establishments, with the exception of [[Tlilcoatl (Halfling Pirate Raiders)]], deep water pirates.
