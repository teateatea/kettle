### Greeting
- Lady: Look upon this, dear riverstone!
- Lord: I shall send for the servants, the ball carries on til sup, I expect.
- Lord: Guests have appeared, 4 in all!
- Lady: Prithee, guests! Step lightly with us. The fete carries our joy, and yours!

### On party declining to dance
- Lady: Ah modest folk, then? Attend to us but a moment and you shall learn the steps! Let not your character spoil your spirit!
- Lord: I too, was once young and coy. Our guests might comfort themselves in our homes, dearling, in their own measures.

### On party asking questions
- Lady: Let us speak not bleakly of the past. Better to keep spirits high! *(Laughs at her joke)*
- Lord: Prithee, dear guest. Holdst thee mine honour, and more, the lady's. Let us not profane her character with speech such as this.

### Caution
- Lord: Triffle not with these tombs, friend. Prithee, they keep only beneath our sights.

### Last Warning
- Lord: Wilst thee spoil their dozen? Away, lest we touch bone to blade and tarnish *both* our oaths.
