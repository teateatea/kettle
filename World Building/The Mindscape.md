## Ability scores in the Mindscape
In general, creatures make the following changes to their profiles while in the Mindscape:
- [[Constitution (Ability Score)|Constitution]]: Use [[Charisma (Ability Score)|Charisma]] instead. Adjust HP.
- [[Strength (Ability Score)|Strength]]: Use [[Wisdom (Ability Score)|Wisdom]] instead. Adjust Melee to-hit bonus.
- [[Dexterity (Ability Score)|Dexterity]]: Use [[Intelligence (Ability Score)|Intelligence]] instead. Adjust Ranged to-hit bonus, AC, movement.

The charismatic people become tough. They do not lose their character when hit.
The wise people become strong. Their understanding is crushing.
The intelligent people become quick. They move as fast as their minds do.

All that sounds reasonable.

Size is generally related to CHA and WIS.
Combat skill is generally related to WIS and INT

HP is set by CHARISMA
Movement is set by INTELLIGENCE.
