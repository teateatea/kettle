## Overview on Butling

## Front Door to First Room

### *How many are you?*

- **Check group size: 4 or 5 are the optimal group sizes.** Less is fine (but slow down the line), and more won't really be able to see much through the crowd.
- **This is where you usually find out about VIPs.** If they don't tell you here, you'll have to kick them out to alert the house.
- **This is a great time to size the group up.** Little kids, gangs of teenagers, adults, scaredy cats, etc. It's nice to pass on information to the actors.
- **Close the door on them.** Just do it everytime, and walk away for a minute. It's nice for them to think we might be making adjustments just for them.
- **Come back and say, "Group of three?"** It's nice for them to feel remembered and makes you look professional.

### *Come in, wait here.*
- **They need to make space for the last guest to enter, and the door to close.** If you don't point deep enough (at the closet), the first guest will only enter as far they would normally stray into a strangers home. This also lets guests know where to stop, to they don't wander off while you close (and lock) the door behind them.
- **You'll need to close and lock the door behind them.** Swing slowly at first so that the guests both inside and outside realize what you're doing and make room.
- **Slam the door from the last 2 inches.** Always audibly close the door. Guests outside need to have heard the slam (so they keep fingers clear of the door), and actors inside can benefit from the knowledge of the beginning of a tour.

### *We're going to tour the house today. Please make sure to stay together, so that nobody gets lost. And if at all possible, shortest people at the front, so that everybody can see.*
- **Stand in front of the Blacklight Room for this intro.** We always block the doorway that the guests should not pass through. Don't block the stairs: actors there should be visible to your side or over your shoulder. Ignore them.
- **"We're going to tour the house today."** This is a tour. It is guided. Do not wander.
- **"Stay together, so that nobody gets lost."** Do not wander alone. You can get lost here. It's nice to punctuate the last word with specific eye contact with whoever looks the most nervous or excited.
- **"Shortest at the front, so that everybody can see."** Pause for a long comma, because the guests inevitably stop listening as they all evaluate their ranking in the group. If the group hears *"so that everybody can see"*, it's amazing how often the group will use that leverage against their own friends, shoving the (usually) most vulnerable guest to the front. We actually do want this order though, it's just nice when they organize themselves this way.

### *Follow me.*
- **Walk to the kitchen doorway, and stand there.** We always block the door that the guests should ignore. Any deeper into the hall, and distracted guests can lose track of you (even if it seems so obvious to you).

### *We're going to go all the way to the end of the hall.*

- **Gesture towards the bathroom, then down the hall.** This is a bit of a trick. We want guests to have a look at the bathroom, and pointing down it is a good way to lead their eyes. You can often mislead the first guest to take several steps into the bathroom, until they hear the word "hall", which is perfect. Without the gesture and the misguidance, the bathroom often gets overlooked as guests tunnel vision to your directions.
- **If anybody *does* step into the bathroom, use "Do you need to use the bathroom?** The answer has been *"No!"* everytime. It's a fun and silly question, and shows that you're reacting to their actions during the tour.
- **Groups sometimes stretch out here.** Don't let the first guest touch any doors yet, and remind any stragglers to stick together please.
- **Wait for the last guest passes in front of you.** Any further and the last guest won't see much. We want all the guests closest to the doors, there's no need for you to get a good view. You already know what's in there.

### *We're going to start with the room on the right.*
