### Design Notes
**Icon of Pyth:** A golden bull, red eyes, nose ring.
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once each enemy is reduced to 0 HP.

Each enemy can make one opportunity attack each round.

Allies may dream details about an incoming encounter. (Usually by reading the creatures profile.)
