## Original Text in [[Wonder & Wickedness]]
##### p.29
The sorcerer must first inscribe a gate sigil on a conscious creature. By casting this spell, the sorcerer (and a number of companions equal to level) may step through the body of the ensigiled creature as if through a door. The creature must save or take one die of damage per traveller, though this damage will only potentially lead to unconsciousness, not death.
