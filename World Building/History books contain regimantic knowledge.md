**Dusty old books are really, really useful.** 

[[Regimancy|Regimantic rituals]] are revealed by flashes of insight, or are discovered accidentally. [[Mancers (Halfling Mages)|There's no way to invent a new regimantic ritual,]] and no practical way to discover them through deliberate experimentation.
  
[[Learning new regimantic rituals looks identical to the study of history]]
  
[[Regimancers]] comb through treatises, accounts, records and tomes trying to find patterns that explain sudden rises to power, remarkable victories from behind, and victorious underdogs. What ritual price was accidentally paid?  
  
Even reasonably well-understood regimantic rituals merit continued study. Does [[Vassal's Gambit]] only work when the enacting kingdom has a green flag? All three examples of the gambit from history have been carried out by rulers whose houses had green flags. Is that a coincidence, or meaningful?  
  
Even the histories of dead empires, so remote to the present in distance and time, could be treasure troves of regimantic clues.
