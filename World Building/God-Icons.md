The Gods of Gods have no names that can be understood by mortals. Instead, God-Icons are used as stand-ins that do not destroy mortal thought. Generally, only high-level Clerics, Wizards and scientists research domains beyond the known gods, and these are what they find.

##### *THE EDGE OF REALITY*
*Technically, this is what you run into when you study reality too closely. These things govern even the Gods, which are a provably real thing in D&D.*
*These are boundaries to the unfathomable. The gods plead with God-Icons, and are unable to force a God-Icon's hand, the same way that mortals cannot force a God's hand.*

> It was probably *God-Icons* caused [[The Faerie Reorientation]], not Gods.
