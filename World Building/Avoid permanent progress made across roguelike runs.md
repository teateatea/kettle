# Avoid permanent progress made across roguelike runs
*See also:* 
___
You get this weird curve where the game starts off way too hard for the PC's current skills.

It's going to end up way too easy with sufficient runs.

The sweet spot (perfectly not-too-difficult, not-too-boring) only exists for a few runs in the middle.
