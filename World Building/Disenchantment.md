## Disenchant
Cancel an ongoing spell (or make a DEX test to interrupt a cast). That spell becomes X spellcrabs, where X is the level of the cancelled spell. 

Spellcrabs have 2 HD, AC 16, ML 8.

## Notes
Pretty much everybody turns spells into crabs. Nobody knows why.

Very high level magic users turn spells into *swans*. Again, nobody knows why.
