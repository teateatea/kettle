## [[Torian Wizards]]
Breeding [[Spells are animals|animus]] is a difficult and dangerous process, but possible. Duplicating a single _anima_ is as unfathomable as having a child by yourself.

## [[Maroian Magicians]]
While you have a hallucination running, it's only as complicated as repeating the spell preparation process as many times as required.
