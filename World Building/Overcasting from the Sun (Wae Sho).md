# Overcasting from the Sun (Wae Sho)
*See also:* [[The Wae Sho - The Caspian Philosophy-Art]], [[The Sun]]
___
If a Maestro casts magic from the Sun more than once per day, this is called Overcasting from the Sun. Each time they do this, roll for Sun Catastrophe.
- Nothing happens
- The Sun falls in love with you, and always shines upon you. You are *always* brightly lit, even indoors or underground. You do not produce light in darkness, but you are incredibly easy to see. Roll CON to sleep, or the light keeps you up.
- The Sun is angered at the sight of you. Treat as [[sun-sensitivity]], you quickly burn when exposed to sunlight.
- The Sun avoids you. You cannot see sunlight, or the sun. Treat daytime as nighttime: You will only be able to see other sources of light, like torches, lamps and fires. You will probably need to walk around in broad daylight squinting with your torch.
- The Sun is insulted. You do not gain mana from the Sun for a long time.
- The Sun is fickle. Roll again on this table twice, rerolling duplicates. Both effects occur at the same time.
