[[Vampires]] Halfling vampire hunters are always elders, so that should they fall, less lifeforce would be drained to feed the vampire.

They are stereotypically the white-haired halflings, or at least gray haired (although actual appearance is entirely unimportant).

The OG Pale Watchers were just the grandpa's staying up all night, leading to them taking day time naps and being grumpy all day. "Quiet down out there kids."
