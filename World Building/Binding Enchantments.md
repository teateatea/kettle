## [[Torian Wizards]]
Notoriously difficult. You need to somehow construct an open cage that also doesn't let the _anima_ just escape. The item basically acts as both a prison for the _anima_ and an external soul-intermediary for the wizard. They basically always recharge if you've done it right though. Generally requires attunement.

## [[Maroian Magicians]]
Only slightly more difficult than [[Transferring Spells|moving or copying a spell]]. The hard part is making charges that spontaneously recharge. Single use items are staple amongst the Maroi. Only rarely require attunement.
