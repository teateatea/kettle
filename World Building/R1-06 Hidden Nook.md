Jacuzzi [heated basalt], caverns [basalt, specific plants],
relief carvings [nude visitors, candle light], narrow rock
arch [hot springs visible outside]

A narrow opening leads to the [[R1-07 Swirling Lake]] outside.
Relief carvings on the rock walls depict those who enter,
in the nude, carrying a candle or lantern. These act as
light sources in the caverns.

Note map change! Make south-west wall into a cavern wall.
Not sure how to represent this, but the doors are different.
Theyâ€™re secret in the pocket dimension, but closed
(Overgrown Passageway) or open (Swirling Lake) normally.
