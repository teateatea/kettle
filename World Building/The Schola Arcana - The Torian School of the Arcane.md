Wizard Arcane Thesis: [/r/Pathfinder2e - My GM asked me what my wizard's arcane thesis was, this is what I sent him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/pml6dy/my_gm_asked_me_what_my_wizards_arcane_thesis_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

[[The Periodic Table of Spells - As Seen by the Schola Arcana]]

THE PARADIGM
A THE ORY OF MAGIC
Here’s the state of the art, expanded from the
original Principia Arcana. This theory also appears in
the Introduction, and is repeated here for convenience
and ease of reference.
Spells are living creatures. Spells, enchantments,
ghosts, and souls are all more-or-less the same.
Souls inhabit a living shell most of the time.
Weak souls require the living shell to be
maintained with food, water, air, etc. Strong
souls, like those of sufficiently magical creatures,
can ignore biology and physics.
A wizard’s spells range in intelligence from pond
scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a menagerieprison.
A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded
with spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips,
infest the wizard’s soul and bind to it. You can
imagine them as extra, mutated limbs, except
stuck to the soul and not the body.
Spells can be bred and trained. Copying a spell is
difficult and tedious. Enchanting an object
means convincing a spell to activate more-or-less
permanently and is exceptionally tricky. Runes
and engravings can help form a combination
prison, racetrack, and factory.
Magical energy is spell food and fuel. It’s
gunpowder for the mind-bullets. Raw magic
generates octarine light, the eighth colour, when
it interacts with normal matter; a faint purplishgreen
sparkle or flare.
Wands are portable brains for storing spells and
magical energy. Powerful wands can act like a
magical battery, storing extra charges for a wizard.
Concentrated magic has a tendency to explode.
Raw magical energy flows from the sun to the
earth. This is why spells return at dawn and many
magical effects only last for a single day.
EIGHTFOLD PATTERNS
The wizards of Endon know that many elements in
the world follow an eig htfold pattern. Aside from
the metals a nd gems covered on the next page,
they recognize:
• Eight colours of light (red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, violet, and octarine).
• Eight points of the compass.
• Eight intervals in the octave.
• Eight possible directions (up, down, left, right,
forward, backward, forward-through-time, and
backward-through-time).
• Eight true celestial bodies (the Sun, Mercury,
Venus, the Earth, the Moon, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn), all others being classified as
“entrapped offspring”.
• Eight elements ( stone, water, ice, fire,
lightning, acid, air, and the newly identified
“void” or “vacuum”).
• Eight perfect geometric forms (sphere,
tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron,
icosahedron, cuboctahedron, and unahedron,
the regular polygon with fewer than zero faces).
Some specious wizards maintain that the “eight
deadly sins” and “eight blessed virtues” fall within
this system. Popular opinion is with them, but, “If
that were so,” High Wizard Brumley once quipped,
“then surely the eight table settings of a formal
dinner service and the eight pawns on each side of
a chessboard would have supernatural significance.”
