##### *WHERE OUR DEAD ARE BURIED*
There is a great contrast between the [[Caspian Natural Gods]], and the Murian Restless Kaghan. While the Natural Gods (and their locations or regions) are usually *discovered* by men, the dominion of the Restless Kaghan is *placed* by men.

Their influence holds sway over land where the Mura have buried their dead (or more accurately, where the Mura still remember having buried their dead).
