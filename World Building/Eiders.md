___
Put a duck on major street corners, then have a [[Eider whistle|secret whistle to wake them up.]] They have cat-slit eyes, and a glowing halo appears over them as any extraplanar being passes nearby (such as the sleeping [[Soulguards|Soulguard]]).

Eiders are apex predators on [[The Spiritual Plane]].

On the Spiritual plane, Eiders appear as feathered dire-tigers. At higher levels, they breath fire.

In Caspia, Eiders are held at as nearly holy symbols. Do not touch an Eider without the express permission of a Soulguard. Do *not* wake an Eider, on pain of *death.* Eiders might be actively protecting, fighting, or transporting a Soulguard, and waking one could result in their death. Soulguards have [[Eider whistle]] to wake their Eiders: It's just a queue that reminds the Eider to return to its body at its' convenience, they barely make any sound in the material world.
