Arcane spells are grouped into 'circles,' functional categories based on the approximate skill level required to cast them. First circle spells are relatively straightforward to cast, and may even be cast by those without the Talent (using magical aids or implements).

As the depth of the circle increases, so too does the difficulty and risk of casting those spells.

### First Circle Spells
Finding someone who can cast a first circle spell is about as difficult as finding someone with a university degree.

In a small village or town (pop. 0-1,000), there may be some percentage of people who can cast first circle spells (0%-20%), but the majority cannot use them without some kind of aid.

In major metropolitan cities (pop. 100,000+), you are incredibly likely to run into people who can cast these spells. You'll probably run into many of them, and they might even serve you coffee.

### Third Circle Spells
Finding someone who can cast third circle spells is about as difficult as finding someone with a Master's degree.

In a small village or town (pop. 0-1,000), there are likely to be a few people with these skills, and they're probably  a *"medium fish in a tiny pond."*

In major metropolitan cities (pop. 100,000+), it's not at all uncommon to run into these folks. In certain areas, particularly in schools and academic social groups, these folks might even be relatively commonplace.

### Fifth Circle Spells
Finding someone who can cast fifth circle spells is about as difficult as finding someone with a PhD.

In a small village or town (pop. 0-1,000), you are unlikely to find this kind of person. There may be a handful, and they're probably near celebrities for it. *"Our little Michael went to Yaleford and came back, can you believe it."*

In major metropolitan cities (pop. 100,000+), they're fairly uncommon, especially amongst the commonfolk. At higher socioeconomic classes, they become fairly common again, but certainly not ubiquitous.

### Seventh Circle Spells
Finding someone who can cast seventh circle spells is about as difficult as finding someone who is a leader of their field, or an astronaut. Think Noam Chomsky or Chris Hadfield. You've heard of one, but you haven't met one. You might know somebody who has met one.

In a small village or town (pop. 0-1,000), there are almost certainly none of these people. Maybe one, they just happen to be on vacation here right now.

In major metropolitan cities (pop. 100,000+), contacting this person requires some level of social clout. They have gate keepers, and everybody wants their attention. *What makes you so special?*

### Ninth Circle Spells
Finding someone who can cast ninth circle spells is about as difficult as finding someone with high-level military security clearance. These are folks at the bleeding edge of their field, and the folks in charge would prefer you didn't even know what they're working on.

These are the kinds of spells that conspiracy theorists claim are real, but have no evidence to back it up. In 20 years, there may be a sufficient collection of evidence to determine with moderate confidence that, yes, a Wish spell could have been cast here.

In a small village or town (pop. 0-1,000), nobody has met anybody who has met anybody who has met a caster of ninth circle spells.

In major metropolitan cities (pop. 100,000+), there are presumably a handful, but they are very, very hidden. They either exist independently and are uncontrollable, or are given an incredibly short leash by the government.
