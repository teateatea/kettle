[[Inyoni]]

[[Characters]]

**Isibankwa Yesigodi** *('Lizard' of-the-Valley)*
One of the village Elders, permanent scowl on her deeply aged face. Isibankwa chose Inyoni as one of the children gifted enough to learn Druidcraft.

**Impuku Somnyezane** *('Mouse of-the-Willow')*
Impuku is one of Inyoni's best friends, another young Druid. Impuku is anxious and quiet, but brightens up with Inyoni.

**Inkabi Yesigodi** *('Ox of-the-Valley')*
Inkabi is Inyoni's uncle, a broad, proud man. He speaks slowly and gently, with a low relaxed chuckle.
