# Spontaneous Casting (Wae Sho)

Imagine that casting magic is like playing the piano. If you ask somebody on their first day to sit down at a jazz bar and play "Happy Birthday" with no sheet music, it's basically guaranteed they won't pull it off.

If you ask an intermediate student who has played Happy Birthday before, there's a pretty good chance they'll get something pretty close, maybe even perfectly if they're familiar enough with it!

If you ask an advanced pianist to play happy birthday at the jazz bar, not only with they play it perfectly but they'll play it *jazzy.*

For Caspian Initiates, attempting a spontaneous casting is a certain [[Spell Catastrophe]], with a minor chance of the intending effect going off too.

For Caspian Maestros, there's a reasonable chance of success, but a relative level of risk for [[Spell Catastrophe]] as well.

For Caspian Dominos, they can pretty much do it. There's a minor risk of Spell Catastrophe, but the spell pretty much goes off as intended. (Although at this point, [[Spell Preparation (Wae Sho)|it might have just been one of the dozens of spells in their actual memory and not a spontaneous casting!]])

Caspians observe Spell Catastrophe with *great* disdain. Imagine a professional pianist just "basically" playing the song. They are internal cringing at their own performance, at the errors, and the imperfections, even if the crowd thinks that was pretty good.
