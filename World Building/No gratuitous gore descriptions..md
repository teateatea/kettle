**_GM Reminder: Stay classy._**

One sentence is probably fine.
- "His hand gets chopped off."
- "You get eaten by the creature."

**No unnecessary length and detail for gore.** No six page essay detailing the damage.

_GM Notes:_ Pretty doable, just don't forget down the line. I can't think of anything that _needs_ excruciating detail, but it could come up I guess? Plenty of very scary things to describe without it being gore lol.
