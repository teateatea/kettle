# The Twelve Saints of Tor

## Patron Saints

Torians follow the Twelve Saints, people whose exceptional accomplishments have raised them to sainthood. While each of these people would have had followers in life, the domains associated with each saint have been chosen post-humously, based on their life's work and motivations. It's the loyalty even after death that grants a saint power; if enough people continuously call upon someone or act in their name, miracles can be granted.

Many of the dead are remembered by a few of their descendents, but widespread memories of these saints have endured the test of time. Farmers may ask for their ancestors blessings, but they also *always* honor Saint Marila as they seed their fields. Beggars always throw a coin for Saint Griselbrand, Scholars always toast to Saint Gilean.

___
> ##### Calling Upon the Lady Most Fair
> Dear Ena Mora, I've crossed the veil,
>
> Won't you take me to the Silent Sea?
>
> If I take your vow, beneath your sail,
>
> Won't you take me to the Silent Sea?
>
> If I leave my voice, my thoughts and tales,
>
> Won't you take me to the Silent Sea?

___
- **Funeral Spires, Cremation, Last Words, Last Rites:** The dead are cleaned and wrapped, then placed inside cremation spires, which range from simple wooden bonfires to elaborate towers. The appearance of the spire doesn't technically matter, but the living tend to build the nicest spire they can afford.
- These serve two functions for the dead: First, fire can be seen across the Veil, and followers of Ena Mora know to draw near a burning spire once they've crossed into the Spiritual Plane. This is the time for the living to speak the last words to the dead (and listen for the last words of the dead).
- Second, their physical bodies will become ashe, so their spirits will not try to claw their way back through the Veil to reach the recognizable. They might recognize other thing through the Veil, but one's own body is usually the most personal and comforting sight in the unfamiliar plane, and many spirits have trouble abandoning their bodies.
- **Spireships:** Next, the ashes are taken to be scattered upon the sea. This is done by the priests of Ena Mora, and is afforded to all followers. Often, family or loved ones will travel with the priests to the sea, but this carries costs that the Church of Ena Mora does not subsidize.

### Worship
___
- **Prayers:**
- **Funerals:**
- **Celebration of the Dead:**



## The Spiritual Plane

Upon death, souls immediately cross the Veil into the Spiritual Plane. This plane is separated from the Material Plane by only a small distance, so there is overlap and the possibility of interaction.



Torians are taught by priests of Ena Mora to call upon the Lady Most Fair to guide them to the Silent Sea. They'll journey to the coast, and set out upon her vessel, where they'll need to take a vow of silence before joining their kin in eternal rest beneath the waves.

However, not all souls go to the Silent Sea. The Spiritual Plane and the Material Plane are closely tied, and there are several implications imposed upon the dead.



- Souls can access the Material Plane, but only through a veil: It's difficult to see, difficult to hear, and the passage of time is very difficult to gage.

- The Spiritual Plane is not inherently safe. While most of the dead do not hold any particular ill-will towards others, there are terrors and nightmares keen on ingesting and absorbing their more placid kin.

- Ghosts (in the Material Plane) are souls that have been lost for too long. They don't understand the Spiritual Plane, and try to claw their way back through the Veil to something familiar in the Material Plane. They are almost always emotional (scared, angry, sad), because the calm don't claw back through in a panic.

- Many beings are very different when they arrive in the Spiritual Plane. The Material Plane emphasizes physical materials, while the Spiritual Plane focuses on energy. This means that very emotional or energetic beings are empowered here, even if they were small in stature in life.

 ## Resurrection
Magic that raises the dead is risky if you care about the results. If you are a Torian who expects to be resurrected, you must do several things while in the Spiritual Plane.
- You must not call upon Saint Ena Mora to lead you to safety. Once you take the vow of silence, you cannot answer a resurrection.
- You must stay as near to your material body as you can, so that you can be the first to answer the call when it comes. Occasionally, a closer soul might breach the Veil instead of you, which is always disconcerting to the living.
- If your body is moved, you must do your best to follow it. While all space in the Material Plane seems to have a corresponding space in the Spiritual Plane, *distance* is not compared at a consistent rate. Therefore, when the living move a body, the dead must be extremely vigilant if they wish to follow it. There is no beacon towards your own body (although some magicians claim to have tools otherwise).
- You must avoid and survive any unfamiliar and treacherous company that might hunt you. There is no guarantee that you will survive until the resurrection takes place.
- You must do all of this for an infinite amount of time, because time does not pass in the same way for the dead. It might take just one day for a cleric reach your body, but that might be a minute or a decade to the dead. It is not yet known how to accurately measure time in the Spiritual Plane from the Material Plane (or vice versa).
- You must pray that you actually will be resurrected. There are those who were *told* they would be resurrected, only for promises to be broken. Those souls will endure an infinite struggle, waiting for a summons that will never come.

# Saint Griselbrand
#### Patron Saint of Generosity & Inspiration
#### Father of the Overlooked
#### Saint Brand of Grisel
#### The Ash Father
#### Steward of the Dying
#### The Slag Sculptor

### 

#### Domains
___
- **Focus:** Generosity and Inspiration
- **Associated:** Inconspicuousness or Concealment, Ash and Decay, Innovation or Invention
- **Humor:** Curiosity, Goodwill, Opportunity
- **Wrath:** Madness, Desolation, Hubris
- **Neglect:** Awkwardness, Oversight, Mediocrity

#### Establishments
___
- **Shrines**: Crucible of Ash, The Starving Crucible
- **Churches & Soup Kitchens:** Temple of the Overlooked (Slack Tubs, Griselbrand Supper)

#### Worshippers
___
- **Priests:** Monks of Griselbrand (Monks, Mendicants)
- **Soup Kitchen Attendants:** Supper chefs (Clinkers)
- **The Starving Crucible:** The Ash Talapoys of Saint Brand of Grisel (The Ash Monks)


### Tasks
___
- **Maintenance of the Crucibles:** Mendicants feed their Crucibles, pyres dedicated to Griselbrand. After leaving any Crucible's light, it becomes difficult to remember the Crucible's location, what happened there or who you met.

As a general rule, there are few ways to return to a Crucible without assistance:

**a)** Eat or drink in its presence. This allows you to remember the Crucible for 2-4 days or so (Every 24 hours, **CON vs DC12:** *On a fail, continue to remember.*)

**b)** Light a new crucible. See below (WRITE THIS) on how to light a Crucible to Saint Griselbrand. Generally requires burning something until a crucible or bowl is completely filled with ash, and any form of prayer to Griselbrand. If you add ash from another crucible, you'll get access to those memories while your new crucible burns.

(**CHA modifier:** *Each worshipper extends the reach of the crucible's light by a number of feet equal to their Charisma modifier, or at least 1 foot. This light is considered dim at all points, no matter its' range. Worshippers add their CHA modifier indefinitely, until they are no longer able to make Charisma checks.*)

**c)** Wait for the crucible to die out. If the crucible is no longer lit, the memories are like a lit candle in your mind. Notable the fewer thoughts you already have, the easier it is to notice. (**WIS vs DC12:** *On a fail, you have a sudden flash of memory of the last time you were there.*) Relighting the crucible will re-extinguish your memories.


 **Maintenance of the Starving Crucible and defense of the Nightmaw:** The Ash Monks feed the Starving Crucible, an eternal pyre dedicated to Griselbrand. Leaving any Crucible makes it difficult to recall the location and experience, but the Starving Crucible is an example of an especially strong one (the strongest crucible known to present company).

Paths between the Material Plane and the Underdark are obscured by the Starving Crucible. This isn't a perfect barrier, but it cuts down most coordinated attacks through the larger rifts. The Rod of Ajira's Forbiddance further reduces traffic upwards through the Nightmaw. (100 ft. radius, vs Fiends & Undead).

# The Caspian Pantheon

## The Mortal Gods

The Gods of Mortals govern all things experienced by mortals, and are most commonly worshiped in Caspia. While each is known by a single Caspian word-name, their jurisdictions span a range of emotion and experience, and can be both positive and negative.

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### Translator's Note
Caspian prose is able to write phonetically identical words with different meanings, but not all languages have this poetic ability. For use in non-Caspian translations, the convention is to use the word-name followed by a descriptor that closely describes the intended interpretation: SHO(faith) vs SHO(admiration) vs SHO(submission). Each of these would be pronounced /ʃo/ or "show" when spoken aloud.
 </div>



Their strengths ebb and flow with civilization, and the interpretation of their will can be highly varied. Even in regions where they should be at their strongest, they are fickle. As such, they're sometimes called the Wandering Gods when compared to the Natural Gods.

War, for example, could easily be interpreted as the hands of RAI(ecstasy), SHO(submission), EL(submission), EL(terror), HET(surprise), VO(grief), TIF(loathing), KOA(rage), or MET(vigilance), depending on perspective. 

The Mortal Gods were manifested through the combined experience of living things, and as such cannot be directly destroyed. Their will is weakest or nonexistent where there are no living things experiencing their domain, so there are likely planes they cannot access (dead planes, fearless planes, trustless planes, joyless planes). To actually kill them, one would need to destroy all living things across all planes that are capable of experiencing their domain.

### RAI - God of Joy
Ecstasy, Joy, Serenity

OPTIMISM, LOVE

### SHO -  God of Faith
Admiration, Trust, Acceptance

LOVE, SUBMISSION

Caspians believe that the Torian Saints are granted most of their power by SHO (and sometimes by other gods). It's the Torian faith in the Twelve that grants SHO strength, and with enough belief, their miracles can be performed. There are no qualms with that fact that Torians do not worship SHO: their faith alone is enough to empower him.

- SHO(acceptance) can bring peace to the loyal. 

- SHO(submission) can grant power to those who rule through oppression.

- SHO(trust) can abandon those who have trusted.

- SHO(admiration) can bring celebrities to fame.

### EL - God of Fear
Terror, Fear, Apprehension

SUBMISSION, AWE

### HET - God of Surprise
Amazement, Surprise, Distraction

AWE, DISAPPROVAL

### VO - God of Sadness
Grief, Sadness, Pensiveness

DISAPPROVAL, REMORSE

### TIF - God of Disgust
Loathing, Disgust, Boredom

REMORSE, CONTEMPT

### KOA - God of Anger
Rage, Anger, Annoyance

AGGRESSIVENESS, CONTEMPT

### MET - God of Anticipation
Vigilance, Anticipation, Interest

OPTIMISM, AGGRESSIVENESS



## The Natural Gods

The Gods of Nature govern all things beyond Mortals. They are many, and are a diverse set of overseers. Usually, these gods watch over land and all that happens within that land, with varying jurisdictions and strengths. Lakes can have gods, seas can have gods, forests can have gods, groves can have gods. Not all land has a natural god, but there's something special happening if a region *does* have a god.

Natural gods may have relationships with Mortal gods. A volcanic region may be said to be visited by VO(Pensiveness) during quiet periods, or a forest god may have bickered with EL(fear), HET(surprise) and KOA(anger) during a forest fire.

# The Murian Pantheon

## The Restless Kaghan





<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### *WHERE OUR DEAD ARE BURIED*
There is a great contrast between the Caspian Natural Gods, and the Murian Restless Kaghan. While the Natural Gods (and their locations or regions) are usually *discovered* by men, the dominion of the Restless Kaghan is *placed* by men.

Their influence holds sway over land where the Mura have buried their dead (or more accurately, where the Mura still remember having buried their dead).
 
 </div>











\pagebreak


# The Gods of Gods

The Gods of Gods have no names that can be understood by mortals. Instead, God-Icons are used as stand-ins that do not destroy mortal thought. Generally, only high-level Clerics, Wizards and scientists research domains beyond the known gods, and these are what they find.



<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### The Edge of Reality
Technically, this is what you run into when you study reality too closely. These things govern even the Gods, which are a provably real thing in D&D.

These are boundaries to the unfathomable. The gods plead with God-Icons, and are unable to force a God-Icon's hand, the same way that mortals cannot force a God's hand.

* Move slowly and heavily; lots of stability
* Speak from the back of the throat

#### Plot Hooks
- The **Iron Shepherds** have been moving southwards since
