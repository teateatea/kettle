## In-World:
The [[Fae]] started all of this. Or, something in the [[The Fae Wild|Fae Wild]] did, a [[The Faerie Reorientation|a very long time ago]].

[[Faeries move through the various planes with ease]] This is partly because [[The mad perceive planar boundaries more easily than most|the mad perceive planar boundaries more easily than most]], and partly because [[The Faewild is oriented across all the others, rather than adjacent|their plane is oriented across all the others, rather than adjacent.]]

### [[Caelian Stack Theory]]

Each [[Planes|plane]] can be imagined as a plate, book, or box, usually several stacked atop one another. In this metaphor, our plate is in a stack, and there are several stacks adjacent to our stack, and there are likely to be more beyond our immediate understanding.

[[The Material Plane]] (that's us) is stacked on top of the [[The Spiritual Plane|Spiritual Plane]], making travel from our plane to theirs (and back) easier than to most other planes. The [[The Elemental Plane|Elemental Plane]], for example, appears to be found several plates below the [[The Spiritual Plane|Spiritual Plane]]. Travel to the [[The Elemental Plane|Elemental Plane]] requires either several legs to the journey, by crossing through other planes, or a significant detour through the [[The Astral Sea|Astral Sea]].

[[The Astral Sea]] is the first crack in this metaphor, but can only be described as the gaps between the plates. It should not exist, and one should not be able to exist outside the stack, but it does, and we do, and this can only indicate that the current theory is incomplete. However, it has explanatory power, and until a better theory is developed, this is the best we've got.

[[Planar Travel|Traveling to other stacks]] almost always requires a perilous journey through the [[The Astral Sea|Astral Sea]]. Exceptions exist of course, like the [[The Underdark|Underdark]], which appears to be placed in a separate, adjacent stack, but at a similar 'height' to ours. This makes direct travel rare, but possible.

Conversely, creatures like [[Angels|angels]] and [[Demons|demons]] are likely to hail from planes in a completely different stack, at completely different heights, and as such our plane almost never has contact with theirs.

---

The [[The Fae Wild|Fae-wild]] is the second major crack in our theory. This plate is a ghost-plate, placed both inside and perpendicularly to the other plates, such that it touches every plate in our stack. Not only that, but it appears to have been stretched so that it touches several other stacks as well.

Interestingly, [[madness appears to be a relatively uncommon trait throughout the planescape]], making the Fae fairly unique. [[The Plane of Chaos|Chaotic planes]] exist, but it seems there's something special about [[the ability to shift perspectives constantly]], and [[chaotic entities are usually _always_ chaotic]]. The Fae use their ability intuitively, [[The mad perceive planar boundaries more easily than most|finding the edges of chaos and law, and thus the edges where planes connect.]]

[[The Faerie Reorientation|faerie reorientation]] was likely done intentionally, and with the intent to [[The Faerie Conquest|colonize other planes]], especially once the Faeries realized that only they [[The mad perceive planar boundaries more easily than most|could see the boundaries.]] It seems that Faeries had not yet realized that [[Faeries become mortal outside the Faewild|they become mortal in other planes]], a side effect they had never before considered. One can only imagine their horror as they discover [[Death|death]] for the first time. When people never go away, suddenly losing one is like losing the sun.

So [[The Faerie Conquest]] was called off, for now. But the plane was left, [[The Faewild is oriented across all the others, rather than adjacent|The Faewild is oriented across all the others|sitting across all the others.]]

Now, denizens of one plane can stumble across the borders of the Faewild without warning, and be stranded in completely unknown territories. Most die, starve, or get killed by the natives. But occasionally they survive, and those survivors tend to keep stumbling.  [[The Faerie Reorientation is the source of magical creatures on the Material Plane|This explains the presence of evolutionarily unexplainable sentient beings]], found thriving and growing beside Men.
