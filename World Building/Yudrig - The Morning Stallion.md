*Foes Shall Cause Harm on Physical Contact*

### Design Notes
**Icon of Yudrig:** A small horse carving/[netsuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsuke).
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it when enemy is reduced to 0 HP.

Physical contact with this enemy deals Ld6 HP. Weapons and implements don't trigger this effect, but armour and clothing don't prevent this effect. It feels like thorns and shingles, it's awful.

Allies gain Ld6 temporary HP at the beginning of each combat.
