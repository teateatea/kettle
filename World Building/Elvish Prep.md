## Encounters
Outside elvish establishments 

Should be approximately 50/50 split male female. Roll 1d100 for androgeny status: 1 is male presenting, 99 is female presenting. 50 is literally androgenous either who knows.

Should be under 200 years old (5% over 200 but say they're 200 lol).

### Elvish establishments 
More regular demographics for age. Bell curve, median age is 750. 2,000 years old is possible, but highly uncommon.

## Names are hella long and fancy.
