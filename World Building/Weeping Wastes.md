# Weeping Wastes
*See also:*
___
Many river deltas here, all the water coming off the [[The Redridge Mountains]]. Probably marshy? Or at least wet.

[[Discontinued Keep in the Weeping Wastes]], an old bastion against [[Dwarves MOC]]: 

Possibly a trade route now if dwarves are friendly with Tor.

[[Shattered Canyons]] on the Northwest edge.

[[The Phandals]] occupied this area 1,200 - 700 years ago.

Despite the apparent source of water and minerals off the mountains, this area does not grow plants. [[The Death of the Phandals]]. [[Heat-Seeking Demons]] have cursed it to burn.

[[Phandalin Capital]]
