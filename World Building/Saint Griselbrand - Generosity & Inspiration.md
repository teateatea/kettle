### Tasks
___
- **Maintenance of the Crucibles:** Mendicants feed their Crucibles, pyres dedicated to Griselbrand. After leaving any Crucible's light, it becomes difficult to remember the Crucible's location, what happened there or who you met.

As a general rule, there are few ways to return to a Crucible without assistance:

**a)** Eat or drink in its presence. This allows you to remember the Crucible for 2-4 days or so (Every 24 hours, **CON vs DC12:** *On a fail, continue to remember.*)

**b)** Light a new crucible. See below (WRITE THIS) on how to light a Crucible to Saint Griselbrand. Generally requires burning something until a crucible or bowl is completely filled with ash, and any form of prayer to Griselbrand. If you add ash from another crucible, you'll get access to those memories while your new crucible burns.

(**CHA modifier:** *Each worshipper extends the reach of the crucible's light by a number of feet equal to their Charisma modifier, or at least 1 foot. This light is considered dim at all points, no matter its' range. Worshippers add their CHA modifier indefinitely, until they are no longer able to make Charisma checks.*)

**c)** Wait for the crucible to die out. If the crucible is no longer lit, the memories are like a lit candle in your mind. Notable the fewer thoughts you already have, the easier it is to notice. (**WIS vs DC12:** *On a fail, you have a sudden flash of memory of the last time you were there.*) Relighting the crucible will re-extinguish your memories.


 **Maintenance of the Starving Crucible and defense of the Nightmaw:** The Ash Monks feed the Starving Crucible, an eternal pyre dedicated to Griselbrand. Leaving any Crucible makes it difficult to recall the location and experience, but the Starving Crucible is an example of an especially strong one (the strongest crucible known to present company).

Paths between the Material Plane and the Underdark are obscured by the Starving Crucible. This isn't a perfect barrier, but it cuts down most coordinated attacks through the larger rifts. The Rod of Ajira's Forbiddance further reduces traffic upwards through the Nightmaw. (100 ft. radius, vs Fiends & Undead).
