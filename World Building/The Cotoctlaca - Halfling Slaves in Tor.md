The Cotoctlaca (*The Missing People*) are descended from those captured as slaves from [[The Ferncombe|Tlacoyoctli Tlecomitl]] 300 years ago. Their religion, [[Ohome - Pantheon of the Halfling Slaves|Ohome]] reflects the halfling situation, a whole split into opposite halves. Neither half lesser, just different.

There is a sizeable halfling population in the [[Torwood]], specifically in [[Frostwick]] and [[Brynn (Village)]].

Between 200 and 300 years ago, [[Halflings Slave-Soldiers]] were used against the [[Elves MOC]]: [[The Torwood War]]. Their [[Halfling Ancestry & Physiology|increased lifespan]] meant that they were resistant to [[Swords that age the victim instead of cutting them|elvish weaponry at the time]]. 

These halfings Do Not Drink.
