Perhaps one has learned a [[Spells (TEPE)|spell]] during the period between [[Spell Preparation (TEPE)|preparing it]], and casting it, because you can still recognize its' [[Spellforms (TEPE)|shape in your mind]]. It's still there, humming adjacent to your soul. After casting it, you no longer know the spell, it's lost. You might still recognize its' 3-dimensional shadow though!
