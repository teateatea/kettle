### Human Naming Conventions
Most humans identify as either male or female. Human parents generally choose a name for the relevant gender when naming their children, with some names being appropriate for either gender.

Non-binary humans exist of course, but they are usually unable to communicate this until years after they're born. As a result, by adulthood most non-binary humans have chosen a new name that's better suited to their identity.
