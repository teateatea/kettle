Likes

Dislikes
Weakness - The person is never weak, it is the situation that is insurmountable.
Laziness = Weakness - The lazy do not carry their own weight, and are reviled.

### Those unable to do work
Strong stigma about not being able to do work, especially for men. Those who are able to work hard are great, but unfortunately those unable to do work are looked down upon. This includes the disabled (both mentally and physically). Friends and families of these people will emphasize what they *are* able to do (Maybe Costa lost his legs but he weaves a mean reed basket).

Men rarely retire, and often become depressed when they do. (The loss of identity is rough for them.) 

Women consider people work to be work, with a strong emphasis on [[Acts of Service]].
