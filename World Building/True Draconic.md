Amongst themselves dragons speak True Draconic. This language is similar to [[Old Magic]], and has the ability to command intent into the world through speech alone. [See Dragon Shouts](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Shouts). Infrequently, mortals learn a word or phrase in True Draconic, and consider these "Magic Words."
