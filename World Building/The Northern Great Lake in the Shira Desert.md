___
3 hexes tall = 360 km
2 hexes wide = 240 km

Take [[Lake Ontario]], stack it like 3 burger patties, and then rotate the whole stack 90°.

Why the fuck is there a desert surrounding a lake? [[The Shira Desert]] is a [[Ruined Kobold Empire]], see [[The Death of the Magi-Tech Kobolds]].


3 hexes tall (on the western coast) = 360 km tall.
2 hexes wide = ~240 km wide.
