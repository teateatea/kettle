*Foes Shall Strike With Greater Ferocity*

### Design Notes
**Icon of Hense:** A rose with a thorned, curling stem. 
**Reveal** this when combat begins. The vines curls around the weapon briefly, before the rose blooms over the creatures forehead.
**Remove** this when they're unarmed or surrender.

Enemies deal an additional 1d4 damage.

At the end of each combat, choose one ally: You heal them for 1d6+L HP.
