___
[[Faeries move through the various planes with ease]]

Fae are functionally immortal.

In the [[The Fae Wild|Faewild]], they do not die. Even when they are 'killed,' they reawaken somewhere nearby within what they consider to be a relatively short amount of time.

On the [[The Material Plane|Mortal Plane]], they can be killed, which confuses and distresses them greatly. To discourage this practice, they inform mortals that even if killed, they will be reborn in the Fae Wild. This is not true, but to encourage this belief, when Fae avenge a fallen friend, they always declare to onlookers that they *are* the fallen friend.

### Age
Fae generally say they are over 4,000 years old. They do this because in their folktales, most fae heroes and kings say something like that and the mortals were impressed.

They think it's like saying you're 6'3" when you have no idea how tall you are, or what height even means. "Who knows man, but the locals seem to like it lol."

They don't really understand mortality and age, so it's like asking, "How old is this water molecule?" Well, it's unrealistic to know when *this* particular molecule connected its two Hydrogens to a Oxygen atom, but it's safe to assume it's been formed sometime between just now and billions of years ago? And even if it breaks apart, it could be reformed, although is it the *same* water molecule? What if one of the hydrogens is different? I'm *a* faerie, but am I the exact same faerie?

Some fae understand mortality a little better, and understand it to be "how long have you continually existed?" but often have trouble differentiating that question from "How far back can you remember?" *("Sometimes years, sometimes weeks, it really depends on the topic am I right?"")*, or "How long have you been awake for?" (Note that time between the Fae Wild and the Mortal plane fluctuates between 1:1 and 1:1,000,000 conversions, so although the Fae could probably actually work out the math, they always vaguely estimate based on current conditions. *"Maybe 6 years?"*).
