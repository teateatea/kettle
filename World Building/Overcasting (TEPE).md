## Casting Spells Without Prepared Charges
Dangerous, but possible. Easy to do in fact.

The issue is not with power, but with cost. [[Spell Slots (TEPE)|Essencial charges]] are discrete, contained loops of [[Essence|essence]], which simply fizzle out when spent: They "fall" when there isn't sufficient energy inside them to maintain the outwards momentum, and the remaining essencial materia is reabsorbed by the soul to be energized.

Overcasting describes casting a spell without using a charge. Instead, essence is drawn directly from the soul in a line, and formed as necessary to cast the relevant spell.

The danger lies not in the casting of the spell, but in the *ending* of the spell. A regular charge simply falls when the energy is spent from them, but an overcast does not have a natural ending point and so must be consciously snipped once an appropriate amount of energy has been transfused.

This requires an uncommon level of self-control. In practice, most Magicians simply do not posses a sufficiently accurate understanding of the power remaining in their souls, nor sufficient control in snipping the spell before their death.

Practicing this technique is broadly a fools errand. Were a magician to overcast [[Fireball]], the spell can easily consume half or more of the magicians life force before he would even consider shooting it. 

Most spells require *approximately* 3-5 heartbeats of essence. Most *magicians* have about 8-10 heartbeats of energy to give, before they become to weak to snip the spell. At 12-16 heartbeats, the entirety of the magicians soul is consumed by the spell, which activates completely uncontrolled.

Yes, it's heartbeats, meaning the rate is variable and incredibly difficult to track during combat.
