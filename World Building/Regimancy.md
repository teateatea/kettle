___
*A class of magic whose ritual steps are the workings of states.*

**Ritual Duration:** Months, or years.
**Effect Themes:** The progress of polities - petty kingdoms, empires, city-states, dynastic succession.

**Guidelines:**
- **Regimantic rituals always look like bone-headed maneuvers or political blunders,** because that's the price you pay to take a short-cut to greater heights. *(Ambushing an inferior army and sacking their capital city isn't regimancy, that's just common sense. Having your only heir slain in battle while leading a foolish war against a superior foe, and then gifting the entire royal treasury to a neutral nearby kingdom, now that's a start!)*
- [[Omens are signs that Regimancy is working]]

Performing regimancy always involves politically significantÂ acts such as:  
1. Giving bank-breakingly lavish gifts.
2. Having bastards.
3. Marrying people with the wrong background.
4. Breaking the succession to a seat of power
5. Oaths of fealty.
6. Breaking great oaths and treaties.
7. Declaring wars.
8. Winning battles.
9. Dying in battle.

The stakes are similarly grand, and involve things like:
1. Cutting reigns short, or 
2. Protecting reigns for three centuries
3. Succession stability
4. Breaking dynasties
5. Ending wars
6. Starting wars
7. Internal strife
8. Sowing dissent among advisors
9. Fracturing polities into factions
10. Outright civil war
11. Inverting the dominant power and their vassals
12. Major environmental effects: farming boons, plagues, ice ages, droughts

Rituals that take years to pull off aren't obvious gaming fodder, but there are a few dimensions that seem pretty useful.  
  
1. [[History books contain regimantic knowledge]]

2. [[Regimancy makes Royal Advisors wicked]]

3. [[Multi-generational regimancy looks like prophecy]]
  
4. [[Culture or customs resulting from Ancient Regimancy]]
  
5. [[Regimantic rituals in progress create weird quests]]

6. [[Keepers of Regimantic Knowledge]]

## Regimancy Ritual Format

### Vocabulary:
**The Actor** - The nation(s) casting the ritual
**A Foe** - The target(s) of the ritual
**A Stranger** - Any entity unrelated to the Actor
**A Friend** - An ally to the Actor
**An Agent** - Any nation or entity

**Taking an Action** - Doing something to further the ritual.
**Means** - All the steps involved in completing the ritual.
**Ends** - The resulting effects.
**The Trigger** - The Action that invokes the ritual's intended effects.

**Strong position** - After an Action, the Agent who performed an attack has this. The Actor basically never gets this.
**Weak position** - After an Action, the Agent who received an attack has this. (Overrides a Strong position.)

**High position** - After an Action, the Agent who received a gift has this. The Actor basically never gets this.
**Low position** - After an Action, the Agent who gave a gift has this.

# Steps of the Ritual
Every ritual has a Stage, and a Play, both carried out by the actor.
The third step has several variations called Scenes, with associated Triggers (activation of the ritual) for each.

List of Scenes:
- A [[Tricks (Regimancy)|Trick]]: Offer - Force: Actor takes an action, Actor takes an action.
- A [[Gambit (Regimancy)|Gambit]]: Bait - Switch/Trap: Actor takes an action, Foe takes an action.
- An [[Ante (Regimancy)|Ante]]: Call - Response: Foe takes an action, Actor takes an action.
- A [[Ruse (Regimancy)|Ruse]] : Burden - Tax: Foe takes an action, Foe takes an action.

Advanced Scenes:
- A Game: Agent action, Agent Action
- Agent action, Actor action
- Agent action, Foe action
- Actor action, Agent action
- Foe Action, Agent action.

## Preparing the Ritual

#### Set the STAGE
The first step is Setting the Stage. This is generally paying some up from cost and signals that you are intending to perform a ritual. This step often goes unnoticed by historians and regimancers alike, because it generally does not significantly alter the course of history for the Actor (but often alters a different nations path instead).

#### Make a PLAY
The second step is Making a Play. At this point, the ritual has begun in full, and the direction of the Actor has had a marked change in the course of history.

# Scenes
## Perform a TRICK
Tricks are probably the most straight-forward Scenes to set up, giving the most control to the Actors. They are generally modest effects however.
##### The Offer
The Actor takes an action. Offer the Play.
##### The Force
The Actor takes another action! This can be incredibly difficult for the Foe to prevent, and allows the Actor to move at their own pace.

## Propose a GAMBIT
Gambits are slightly tricky Scenes to set up, but offer some lee-way to the Actor. 

When the Actor takes an action, observant Foes do not know if it's a Trick or a Gambit. Occasionally, the Foe takes a preemptive action, thus conveniently Making the Switch. Some Foes, especially in-observant Foes, require some additional goading. The Actor must Push the Trap, until the Foe Enters the Trap.

##### The Bait
The Actor takes an action. Bait the Play

##### The Switch/Trap
The next step requires action by the Foe.

When the Foe chooses this of their own accord, they have Made the Switch.

When the Actor forces the Foe's hand into action, the Actor has Pushed the Trap and the Foe has Entered the Trap.


## Collect an ANTE
Antes are unusual plays, almost always set up against inobservant Foes. Antes, like Tricks, allow the Actor to Trigger the Ritual at their convenience. HoweverBecause the Foe must participate in these scenes, the effects can be moderate to strong.

##### The CALL
A common third step is Calling the Play. This requires the Foe to make some action towards the Actor, usually causing another significant change in the Actors history.

##### The RESPONSE
The Actor takes an action.

## Preparing a Ruse
Ruses are the most complicated Scenes to set up, because they require the Foe to tie their own noose, and hang themselves with it. Ruses produce the strongest effects of any scene.
#### The BURDEN
The Foe takes an Action.
#### The TAX
The Foe takes another Action. This can be difficult to achieve, especially because the Actor is often already in a compromised position.
