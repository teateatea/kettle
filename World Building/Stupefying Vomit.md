___
### Stupefying Vomit - Witch NPC
*The witch heaves, and projectile vomits at her enemies. The vomit is like hot lube, transparent and thick, but filled with pine needles, and smells like gin.*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action.

**Range:** 10' [[Cone]].

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity Check.
- **Success:** No immediate effect, but the vomit starts to sizzle.
- **Failure:** *Some of it gets in your mouth.*

Next round, creatures who failed their Dexterity check fall unconscious. All creatures who still have the vomit on exposed skin must make a **Constitution Check** or are become blind and nauseous for 10 minutes.

*It's a little bit like instantly being the absolute drunkest you have ever been. You can't stand up, lights are dazzlingly bright and just instantly cause migraines, and shadows are dizzying, unfocussed black holes.*
