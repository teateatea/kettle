They're generally baseball-sized crystals. When initially discovered, they're usually inert.

Once brought to life, they actually glow like a bottle of lava, Lava lamp style?

Carve a statue of a dwarf. Don't make him too tall, it makes caving annoying. Don't make him too short, the other races will call him cute. Make it out of something strong. Stone is good, pick good stone. Metal is good too. Use at least a bit of clay.

Make him [[Dwarvish Values]]things.

Put the statue in some kind of large barrel. Put the statue in the thing, put a dwarf heart on the statue, usually in their hand, then fill it with alcohol.  Dwarven establishments have [[Dwarvish Ceremonial Birthing Grounds]], with basically hot tubs of alcohol.

The dwarf heart will begin to absorb the alcohol. It drinks the fuel. After about 12 days,  the dwarf heart becomes visible again (liquid surface level has lowered sufficiently), put a fire to it and it will ignite. At this point, the dwarf is considered alive, but it will only have enough energy to lower its outstretched arm back into the liquid to gather more fuel. 

It will continue to drink alcohol for quite some time. For the sake of convenient measuring, each [[Dwarvish Ceremonial Birthing Grounds|creation vessel]] is exactly decimal-12 dozenal-10 times the volume of the dwarf inside. The dwarf will drink a gross (dozenal-100 aka 10x10, or decimal-144 aka 12x12) times their body volume, and about one times their volume per day.

Total time is 12 days initial, 1 day fire, 144 more : 156 days.

Dwarvish counting 10 days initial, 1 day fire, 100 more : 111 days.

[[Dwarves use base-12]]
