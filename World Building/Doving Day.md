[[Torian Holidays]]

300 years ago, the day after [[The Battle of the Hearth|The Battle of Ferncombe]], thousands of doves took flight over [[Tor Capital]], signalling the end of the War.

The local rulers said this was them, but it was in fact [[The Cripple's Ante]].

Kind of like remembrance day.
