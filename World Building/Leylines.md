# Leylines
Leylines are hidden, magical paths across the world.

They may be associated with the [[Moon]], so they generally cannot be found in [[The Underdark]], nor in [[The Spiritual Plane]].

## Leylines in the [[The Material Plane]]
In the Material Plane, leylines are usually straight, or circular. 

## Leylines in the [[The Fae Wild|Fae Wild]]
In the Fae Wild, all leylines are curved. 

## Navigation of the Leylines
### [[Elves MOC]]
Elves can only travel leylines under the light of the moon.

### [[Fae]]
To native Fae, the straight leylines on the [[The Material Plane|Material Plane]] all appear crooked, like a painting on the wall: Entirely possible to enjoy and appraise, but definitely wrong (and insane if intentional). And the circular ones are incredibly confusing, like hyperbolic geometry:

The Fae Wild Leylines are as comfortable as strolling through a well maintained garden, stress-free and generally enjoyable.
