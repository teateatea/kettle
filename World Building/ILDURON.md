[[Separate Leaflet Map]]

Consider divide by 3! Too big!

6 mile/9.66km

24 miles / 38.62 km

x 12 = 72 mile hexes



This map is 30 x 30 [[Hex Map]]. Moving from one hex to the next takes about 3 days (120 km / 78 miles).To cross from one edge to the opposite edge would be
- 3,600 km / 2,340 miles.
- 3 months / 90 days.
- Represents a space spanning approximately the same distance as the western edge of British Columbia to the eastern edge of ontario.
- Represents a span approximately the same distance as the northern edge of Manitoba to the southern edge of Texas.

Walking from Chesterfeld to Millburn takes about 6 days (2 hexes x 3 days) and would be similar to walking from Toronto to Kingston.

From Phandalin to Gimhurdin is about 960 km, approximately the distance from London, ON to Quebec City. (In practice, traversing the [[Southern Maroian Mountains]] would significantly slow the pace of travel.)
