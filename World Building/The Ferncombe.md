Fern + prairies

Probably faeries or something here.

[[Halfling MOC]] used to live here, about 350-400 years ago. They were taken as slaves by humans, and moved to [[Brynn (Village)]]. The survivors moved south to the [[The Breaker Plains]]. That was 7 halfling generations ago, or about 14 human generations.

The original homeland of the Halflings. They call it *Tlacoyoctli Tlecomitl* (literally, Kitchen Hearth).

[[Ferncombe has 300 year old halfling holes]]

There are no longer halflings here, although [[there are rumblings to retake the old halfling homelands]]![[Plains-Throne-of-Eldraine-MtG-Art.jpg]]![[Plains-Kaladesh-MtG-Art.jpg]]
