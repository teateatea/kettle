A warm, wide room with a low starry ceiling, covered in
waving foliage. Tickleweed grows on the walls, and
creates bushes over the furniture throughout the room.
The ceiling is a pale iridescent tile with specks of starlight
lazily drifting through it, continuously draws heat from
above to emit here. A shallow, dry fountain sits to the
south. In the south-east corner, cords of wiry pale roots
push from the [[R1-05 Overgrown Passage]] through an open
secret door to the [[R1-02 Atrium]].
