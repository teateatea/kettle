The weather matches the storyline, ignoring actual meteorology.

The rules are based on fiction:
- Something sad happens, it begins to rain.
- Something happy happens, the sun breaks through the clouds.
- Something ominous is going to happen, the cloud gather and begin rumbling.

The sky in the Fae Wild should always be described as though it were a sunset: Golden colours, pinks, warm watercolour, deep ocean blues.

Generally describe default weather as cotton candy.
