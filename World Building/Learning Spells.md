## [[Torian Wizards]]
Not really a thing. You can become familiar with an _anima_, or learn to manage several at once, but that's about it. You don't "learn rats" like you "learn french". You learn _about_ rats, or maybe about a particular rat.

## [[Maroian Magicians]]
Perhaps one has learned a spell during the period between preparing it, and casting it, because you can still recognize its' shape in your mind. It's still there, humming adjacent to your soul. After casting it, you no longer know the spell, it's lost. You might still recognize its' 3-dimensional shadow though!
