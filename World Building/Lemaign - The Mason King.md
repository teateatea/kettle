*Foes Shall Induce Sloth With Each Strike*


### Design Notes
**Icon of Lemaign:** A hammer, wrapped in leather.
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once the enemy is reduced to 0 HP.

Enemy hits reduce the targets combat movement speed by 10', stacking to a minimum of 5'. This effect ends at the end of combat. It feels like your limbs got heavier.

As long as the Halfling is standing and in line of sight, minions roll for combat morale with advantage. If the Halfling's level is more than double a minion's level, that minion never breaks, regardless of the results of the morale roll.
