Magical radiation?

Magical detonation accelerant. Accelerates the hum of the weave, contagiously.

The Shira desert is *incredibly* dangerous for casters. Everything goes 20 times as hard, as fast. Casters will probably age at 20 times the speed (365 days of aging in 18.25 days).
- 30 days in the Shira is 600 days, about 1 year 8 months.
- 1 year in the Shira is 20 years.

Magical prison.

Magical shackles tethers teleport you to the same spot HARD. Every day. Minor explosion as you leave.
