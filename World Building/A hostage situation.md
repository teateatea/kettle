# A hostage situation
*See also:* 
___
some kind of bank robbery


The robbers come in and immediately knock a 60 year old guard out with a lead pipe.

They knock out the first female teller with the pipe too.

The last teller: They point a weapon at her head (like a crossbow or a gun), and pull the trigger. The shot is an illusion and shatters like glass as it goes into her head. "The next shot is *real*."
