# Witches
*See also:* [[Magic Users]]
___
Witches are found infrequently in [[Tor MOC]] and [[Caspia]], but are much more common in [[Maroi]] (where a witch always exists near a [[Burned down Church]]). 

They may act as [[Maroian Spies|counter-spies]] within Maroian borders.

There is only [[The One Witch in Mur|one witch in Mur]]. There is [[The Axcualli|one halfling witch.]]

They generally wield the [[Cunning Craft]], but based on [[The Witch from the Witcher Season Two]], they should also be attempting to use [[Regimancy]]

## Design Notes
## The Witch
- They have a [[Cunning Craft#1 Blackstaff - Melee Buff|Black staff, walking stick, or cudge.]]
- They can [[Cunning Craft#3 Tune of the Yondkind - Creature Detection|detect any nearby creature while singing.]]
- They should have [[Cunning Craft#Spherical Object Witchmark| an apple or other small sphere.]]
- They have [[Cunning Craft#3 Seven Steeped Stones - Minor Healing Ranged Attack|Use Seven Steeped Stones, and a bottle of milk brew.]]

- When encountering multiple witches, choose an additional specialty for each witch from [[Marvels & Malisons]].
