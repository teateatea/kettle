___
Caverns [swirling hot springs], basalt wall fragment
[rubble, choked with pale roots, broken elvish statues]

A nereid, Talia, is trapped behind the rubble here, and is
desperate to escape certain death. Salamanders pushed
a wall fragment off the crumbling bathhouse, intending
to return with reinforcements to capture her. Now, pale
roots are growing through cracks in the debris and sheâ€™s
starting to hear shadowy whispers from the cavern walls.
The [[chime key from the Red Crown Bar]] opens a
secret doorway in the back of the cave, leading to a
[[shrine to Hedonia below]]. If the secret door is
opened, d6 shadows immediately leap out.
