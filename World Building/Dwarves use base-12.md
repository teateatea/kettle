Convert numbers to base-12 (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X E 10)


Numeration on this site is in dozenal (also called duodecimal, or base twelve), using "X" for ten and "E" for eleven.

PDF documents may use a Dwiggins stylized "X" and "E" or the Pitman inverted "2" and "3".

The Humphrey point, or semicolon, is used for fractional parts; e.g., "0;6 = 0.5."
