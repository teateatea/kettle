High ceiling [conical opening, second floor ledge, 30’ up],
three wide archways [20’ high, 80’ wide, glass shards, leads to the [[R1-01 Ruined Patio]]],
tunnel (north, 10’ up, 10’ wide, curved floor, flat ceiling,
ambermoss, leads to [[R2 Bathhouse Ruins - Second Floor]]), mosaic tiles [broken patterns, plants, roots,
shimmering ceiling], open secret door (relief of two elves,
pale roots, hot draft, leads to [[R1-03 Wide Hall]])

The ceiling stretches upwards like the inside of a long
spiral shell, while a much smaller tunnel draped in
ambermoss leads to the [[R1-03 Wide Hall]] to the north.
Swirling, old mosaics cover all surfaces, but the tiles
above exactly 10’ are lighter, reflective, and slightly
bioluminescent. A north-eastern door (also leads to [[R1-03 Wide Hall|the Wide Hall]]) with two elves
locked in an embrace is held open by cords of pale roots
growing towards to grand patio.

Western doorway to the [[R1-15 Spa]] after changerooms.
Eastern doorway leads to the [[R1-07 Swirling Lake]] after changerooms.

*Note map change! Additional access to the Wide Hall.*
