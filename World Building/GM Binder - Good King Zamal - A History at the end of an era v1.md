## Good King Zamal

#### *A History at the End of an Era*
#### *by Professor Morriwick Given* 
#### *45th Year of the Good king*

### Chapter 3: The Circle of Zamal

The Mages of King Zamal's Circle have never been confirmed dead. Many of them were never reliably confirmed *alive* either, nor was any public record ever officially published listing their ranks. However, Good King Zamal was relatively open about the existence of the Circle, and occasionally attributed some success to the efforts of his mages. 

The size of the Circle was never discussed, but five names were mentioned over the 40 years of his reign. There has been frivolous debate over these names, and little real information. Were there only five? Were there more than five? Was each name an individual, or a team of mages? What if there was no Circle? Conspiracies abound, and there was no reason for Zamal to divulge information. Wizards are usually secretive, and these wizards were no different.

Certain universities of magic are rumoured to have either tutored a Circle Mage in their youth, or had been contacted by a Circle Mage for collaboration or information. Unfortunately, documentation of these anecdotes is impossible for outsiders to procure, and alumni of arcane universities never confirm rumours that cast a positive light on any school but their own.

The best source of information available has only ever been Zamal himself. To that end, we can only go by his descriptions of work, and the names to which he attributed that work.

**ALSIUS:** Alsius is most often mentioned in relation to open warfare, and usually during the early period of Zamal's reign. Soldiers' accounts of conflicts attributed to Alsius are often extremely vivid. They describe their victories against impossible odds, battle magic ripping across foreign terrain, and rampant shockwaves twisting army lines into chaos.

Note however, that these accounts, while consistent, are unreliable at best, as they mostly originate from

soldiers who retired due to battle-fatigue long before being surveyed.

**CALLIDUS:** Perhaps the most well-known Circle Mage, Callidus was the creator of the Dragonknights, and the Dragon Phalanx. The result an incorruptible symbol of justice that was vital to Zamal's consolidation of Caelondia.

Beyond this, Callidus was an insightful guardian and a prolific researcher in the era of the Good King, often preparing contingencies years in advance of a conflict. Due to the frequency with which he is named, it is likely that Callidus worked closely with the Good King.

**MELLA:** The Secret-Keeper Mella was the most feared by Zamal's enemies. She was the subtlest mage, whose machinations would not be known until it was too late, or more terrifyingly, might never be known.

Her work generally involved information, uncovering the intents and actions of enemies and allies, sowing misinformation to spies, and watching (or manufacturing) paranoia-inducing rumours. It was said that one need never worry about Mella's whereabouts, because she is always watching *you*.

**VENATIO:** The Wild Warden was described by Zamal as "the first bastion against the forces of chaos." While he was rarely referenced during talks about any specific project, he was regularly publicly thanked for his "ongoing efforts in the field." (Note however, that regularly only means two or three times each decade.)

It is likely that it was due to Venatio that no major destabilizing catastrophe occurred during the reign of Zamal. No successful invasions by the uncivilized, no nation-level natural disasters reversing our progress, and no sweeping infestations or epidemics within our city borders.

**VIRI:** Viri was the least publicly mentioned name, and the least understood. He is occasionally brought up in the context of supporting the other Circle Mages (most often either Callidus or Mella), but rarely with any discussion about the specifics of his contribution. 

The *Arcane University of Tal'Arrar* has often and consistently maintained that they tutored a prodigious wizard by the same name. They have claimed since his first attribution that he had attended their renowned *Scola Sacramentum*, asserting that most of his works surrounded research in Conjurative Sciences.

### Historical Discussion of the Circle

In the coming chapters, we will reference any work that Zamal specifically attributed to a mage or the Circle, whenever possible. However, due to the difficulty of finding reliable sources beyond the Good King, we will simply attribute any arcane projects to Zamal.

This will result in a very uneven distribution, wherein mages like Alsius and Callidus are oft discussed, while the other three might appear to be forgotten or missing. It is our opinion that incorrect information is worse
