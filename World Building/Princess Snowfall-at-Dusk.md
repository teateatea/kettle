## **Background**: 
The seventeenth daughter of the [[The Cold Prince|Cold Prince]]. The princess has been **imprisoned for centuries**, forgotten by her father, waiting with fairy patience to find a way to be reunited with [[Sir Chyde]].

Undeterred by death and many centuries, the princess stubbornly insists on holding a **perpetual wedding feast**, awaiting the arrival of Sir Chyde. *Some few, brave friends and allies have journeyed in secret to her isolated tower to join the long-delayed festivities.*

## **Key Info**:
##### ▶ **The Princess’s Plea**
- **Her wish:** She yearns to be reunited with her love, [[Sir Chyde]].
- **Proposal:** The PCs return to the tomb and bring her the [[Ring of Soul-Binding|ring]] that lies in [[Sir Chyde]]’s coffer. His soul will follow, bringing the two lovers together and allowing them to finally be married.
- **Possible rewards:** Jewels. A [[wish]] granted.

##### ▶ **Knows:**
- That Sir Chyde’s soul lingers in his tomb.
- The names of his hounds ([[Chedr]] and [[Flaegr]]).
- That the warded paths into the forest lead to his tomb in the mortal world.

##### ▶ **Magical ban:**
- Cannot leave the glade in which her [[15 Tower on a Frozen Lake|15 tower]] stands, unless she renounces her love for [[Sir Chyde]].
- The ban is also effective against magical summons or teleportation *(e.g. the power of the [[Ring of Soul-Binding]] to physically unite the bound persons on nights of the full moon).*
