# The Varied Trades


## A Cultural Code
Rather than form guilds, many rogues of varying trades have
developed a common system of signifiers in order to make
ease of their dealings in the public eye without drawing the
attention of law enforcement. Some roguish operators will
create syndicates, while others simply display their
availability for hire for those aware of the cypher to make
offers as they please.

## Identification

A member of the Varied Trades may choose to identify
themselves to others in the know by use of an accessory worn
in two parallel bands, as plain or intricate as the rogue
prefers. The location in which the accessory is worn also
indicates the speciality of the individual displaying it.

|  |  | 
|:---|:---|
| ***Con Artistry.*** | Left Ear. |
| ***Counterfeiting.*** | Right Ear. |
| ***Assassination.*** | Necklace or Choker. |
| ***Smuggling.*** | Armband. |
| ***Espionage.*** | Unknown.* |
||
| ***Stalking.*** | Left Thumb. |
| ***Pocket Picking.*** | Left Index Finger.|
| ***Kidnapping.*** | Left Middle Finger.|
| ***Interrogation.*** | Left Ring Finger. |
| ***Forgery.*** | Left Pinky Finger. |
| ***Intimidation.*** | Left Wrist. |
|||
| ***Reconnaissance.*** | Right Thumb. |
| ***Trapfinding.*** | Right Index Finger. |
| ***Lockpicking.*** | Right Middle Finger. |
| ***Burglary.*** | Right Ring Finger.|
| ***Theft.*** | Right Pinky Finger. |
| ***Fencing.*** | Right Wrist. |

##### *Spy Games
While it is common belief among the varied trades
that spies operate in a similar manner to other
rogues and understand the Cant, if one has ever
been approached with the appropriate greeting,
they have never revealed it by reciprocating
confirmation of the craft.

## Lay of the Land
A rogue seeking generally applicable knowledge upon
arriving in a city should look for a deck of cards. Any signified
individual actively using a deck of cards will respond to a
greeting recognised as an appeal for information - so long as
they're paid for their trouble.

### Calling a Spade a Spade

As a character with the Thieves' Cant feature pays into a
playing card service, the varied trader dealing the cards will
encode a message into each hand. Wherever or whomever
they're discussing as the hand is dealt will be the topic to
which the cards pertain. A rogue hunting down information
can guide conversation to specific intel the dealer might be
able to give, but should be subtle about it lest the dealer shut
the game down. When the enquiring rogue has had their fill,
they exit the game, leaving their contributions to the pot as
compensation.

Not every tavern or city will have a roguish individual willing
to stand post and give up their time to others of the varied
trades, but the bigger the city, the higher your chances of
encountering someone looking to make some easy coin in
this way.

## A Game of Cards
The key phrase greeting to win a rogue in the know a place at
the information table is **"Nice to find a friendly face in an
unfamiliar town"**, or statements to similar effect. Once
welcomed to take part, the rogue will need to match the suits
of the cards they are dealt in each hand with the seemingly
innocuous topics of conversation floated by the dealer during
that round. The meanings of the suits are as follows:

|  |  | 
|:---|:---|
| **Hearts.** | The location or individual mentioned provides a measure of safety for rogues practicing the varied trades. |
| **Diamonds.** | The location or individual mentioned serves as a wealthy target for thievery one way or another. |
| **Clubs.** | The location or individual mentioned is well protected or heavily guarded. |
| **Spades.** | The location or individual mentioned is a good bet for sourcing dishonest work. |

These cards may be combined to form more detailed
messages for the information seeker. For example a person
may be described using three diamonds and two clubs to
indicate that they're attended by personal guards but that
things stolen from them fetch a good price.
