___
Soulguards, are like [[Bodyguards|bodyguards]] but for your [[Souls|soul]].

[[Eiders]]

Sleeping soul guards prevent extraplanar threats.

What do they do while they're awake? Strategic repositioning, attacking from different locations (attack from a library, from a newborns home, etc). Research about the opposition, [[Divination Magic]] based on their missions.

Some can be awake and asleep at the same time. How does that work?

## Appearance
They're always male, and usually are 50+ years old. They have beards and mustaches, and they're generally a little on the wiry side, maybe with a bit of a belly.

Take the jedi habit, and keep the undershirt light teal so they have like a white chest. Make the outer jacket orange with black stripes (obviously a tiger motif).

They generally have a clementine [[Soulguard Turban]] to go with it, often adorned with jewelry. It's not uncommon to see an [[Eiders|Eider]] nesting on the turban.

They always posses an [[Eider whistle]].

#### Spiritual Plane
They present as warriors, twice the size of normal humans.

## Culture
They're often seen seated cross legged against a wall, apparently meditating with their Eider (who may be nesting on their turban, or literally nesting in the street). The Eider is *never* disturbed by natives, who give the birds incredibly wide berths.

In reality, the Soulguard, and their Eider, are almost always straight-up sleeping. It's considered rude to be excessively noisy when a Soulguard is around, but in practice Caspians just avoid making any sudden bangs or crashes. The Yellow City is never really quiet, and the Soulguards are used to it.

Touching a Soulguard is considered a fineable offense. *Waking* a soulguard is punishable by death. They may be in a delicate situation on the Spiritual Plane, and ripping them back to their material bodies could result in actual deaths.

## Function
Soulguards are guards that exist mainly on [[The Spiritual Plane]].

They always have *very* high Wisdom. They generally have above average Intelligence or Charisma, until higher levels where both are above average.
