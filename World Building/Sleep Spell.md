# Sleep Spell
___
**Duration:** 4d4 turns
**Range:** 240’

A *sleep* spell causes a magical slumber to come upon creatures, excluding the undead. The spell may target either:
1. A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice *(see [[OSE Hit point modifiers|Hit point modifiers, OSE p150]])*.
2. A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of 4 HD or lower each.

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the following rules apply:
▶ **Weakest first:** Targets with the least HD are affected first.
▶ **HD:** Treat monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD and monsters with a fixed hit point bonus as having the flat HD. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster would be treated as having 3 HD.)
▶ **Excess:** Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

**Killing:** Creatures enchanted by this spell are helpless and can be killed instantly with a bladed weapon.

**Awakening:** Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature.
