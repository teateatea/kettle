[[Fae Ancestry]]

Very long lifespans and very high wealth encourage low reproduction rate. Reproduction is almost always ceremonial (the same way marriage is almost always a ceremony. You *can* get married with just you, your partner and some clerk signing a paper without celebration, but culturally it feels weird not to do *something*.) Elves usually travel to a very sacred site and live there for a year before bearing children, and otherwise rarely conceive children outside those conditions. (About as often as marriages with *zero* fanfare happen: It has definitely happened before, but like. It's highly unusual to not even invite your parents or friends to dinner or something.)

Are functionally immortal, they can be killed but don't age or disease.

To convert timelines, divide or multiply by 20.
i.e. A war from 200 years ago feels like it happened 10 years ago.

An elf living past 2,000 is seen the same way we see centenarians, great respect, people ask them questions about history, etc. Elves of this age generally join the [[Noon King]] in the Fae wild. [[Elvish Heaven]]

Elves say they send their young (under 200) out into the world to gain experiences. This is broadly true, but ALL elves tell humans they are under 200.

Humans don't need to know how old you really are.

NEVER tell a race you are older than 5 times their elders, that's just common sense.

## Sex & Gender
Physiologically, elves do have two sexes (male and female), but this generally has little bearing on their position in society, nor their outward appearance.

Elves care about *beauty* above all else. If the King's Guard appears all male, that's an aesthetic decision rather than a gender requirement. If Shadow Dancers appear female, that's also an aesthetic decision. Any elf, male or female, can hold any position, assuming they pass the audition, which generally includes initial judgement of the physical appearance first, then tests of the relevant skills second.

Luckily, Elves are able to slowly shift their outwards appearances, with the passage of significant amounts of time. Those with significant understanding of the arcane may recognize this similarity to the Elvish cousin, [[Changelings]].) This process takes between 20 and 100 years, depending on how drastic a change is expected, but otherwise happens smoothly and painlessly. (this feels like 1-5 years for the Elf though.) The [[Elvish Trance]] appears to be at least partly related to matching the outward physiology to the inward intent.

This feature of elvish physiology often results in humans describing elves as fairly androgenous. Most elves consider the extreme ends of the spectrum to be simple and uninteresting (the manliest man or the girliest girly are both just not as complexly elegant as "strong yet supple, sharp yet gentle"), and therefore not worth the additional years spent attaining that appearance.

Additionally, young elves, who are more likely to be seen by non-elves, are also more likely to still be experimenting with their appearances. Elves mid-transition can appear *very* androgenous, much to the confusion of Men (and the amusement of Elves).

## Elvish Naming Conventions 
They're always vivid poetic imagery. They're generally befitting an elf of their position, and almost never particularly related to gender. Elves take new names as Men take new jobs. Usually the new name has some linguistic reference to their old name (the way the Chinese characters can be used inside other characters), but otherwise Elves find it fun when their friends reintroduce themselves.


(Kind of the same way that you find it fun when your friend declares himself "Rabar the Barbarian" for the evening lol.)
