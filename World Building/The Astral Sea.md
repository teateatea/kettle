# Environment 
The air is exactly the temperature of your skin, but a little on the humid side. Just a little clammy.

The water is -20°, absolutely frigid quicksilver. You can see familiar stars in the water below you, but they're inverted to how you'd expect them to be.

Use Charisma check to will your boat forwards.

In general, the GM should request different ability checks and saves fr challenges specifically related to the Astral Sea:

- [[Constitution (Ability Score)|Constitution]]: Use [[Charisma (Ability Score)|Charisma]] instead.
- [[Strength (Ability Score)|Strength]]: Use [[Wisdom (Ability Score)|Wisdom]] instead. Adjust Melee to-hit bonus.
- [[Dexterity (Ability Score)|Dexterity]]: Use [[Intelligence (Ability Score)|Intelligence]] instead. Adjust Ranged to-hit bonus, AC, movement.

### Living in the Astral Sea
Characters who make an effort to *remain* on the Astral Sea eventually 'gain their sea legs.'

Your eyes turn silver.

- HP is now calculated using their Charisma.
- Melee to-hit and damage bonuses are calculated using Wisdom.
- Ranged to-hit bonuses and AC are calculated using Intelligence.
- Movement is calculated as 5' x CHA bonus x WIS bonus, minimum 10'.
