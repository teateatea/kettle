## DM FACING RULES:
- The Casting nation must bestow a gift upon a neutral nation. This gift sets the amplitude of the ritual: A minor gift moderates the ritual, while a life-changing gift multiplies the rituals effects. See [[The Origins of Saint Acobi]]. **Omen:** The success of the Neutral Agent is an indication of the multiplier on this ritual. Saint Acobi is FUCKING BALLER so there's a SIGNIFICANT FORCE MULTIPLIER HERE. We'll say FM = 100

- The casting nation must unnecessarily split their forces in two during a battle: [[The Battle of the Hearth]] **Omen:** The further this happens from home, the more quietly this ritual will occur. If this happens close to home, this ritual will be fucking violent. Battle of the Hearth literally happens in their home capital, so Violence = 100%. [[Doving Day]]

- The target nation must inflict some level of suffering upon the casting nation's people: [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor]]

Trigger: 
- The casting nation swears an oath of support to a neutral nation (can be diffirent than the neutral agent in step 1). Failing to follow through when asked will result in the casting nation losing twice as much as was asked for. [[The Danarak Jungle]]

Result: 
- The target loses their center or capital.
- If the target continues to inflict suffering upon the casters people, they continue to lose their largest city until the suffering ends.

#### Setting The STAGE
***The Actor must bestow an awesome Gift upon a destitute Stranger.***
	*The Fullness of the Gift, measured by the Furtherance of the Stranger's Cultivation, shall determine the Vastness of the Ritual. WATCH FOR THE BIRTH OF A STRANGER WITHOUT HERITAGE, LEST SHE SEEK AMBITION.*

#### Making a PLAY
***The Actor must choose a reckless Foe, and be split upon his Ramparts.**
	The remoteness of the Ramparts, measured from the Hearth of the Actor, determines the Docility of the Ritual. WATCH FOR THE SYMBOLS OF PEACE, LEST THEY MARK INJURY THENCE.*

#### CALL the Play
***The Foe must levy a terrible Burden from a guiltless Actor.**
	The Cost of the Burden, as measured by the Actor, shall determine the Strength of the Ritual. WATCH FOR THE SOBER QUARRY, WHO WELCOMES HIS MISFORTUNE.*

#### The Final RESPONSE
***The Actor must oath Fealty upon an unlikely Stranger.**
	The Fealty invokes Retribution upon the Foe, with the Strength, Docility, and Vastness of the Ritual. Should the Stranger's Petition goes unanswered, twice the Cost of the Petition shall be sown to the Actor, and twice again the Cost of the Burden shall be sown to the Foe. WATCH FOR UNLIKELY VISITORS, LEST THE STRANGER ALIGHTS UPON YON SPIRE.
