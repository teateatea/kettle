___
She's described as the Mother who apparently gives birth to all, and awaits to greet the dead.

-   "Mother only knows."
-   "Mother, this one's for you."
-   "Well, if you can't burn 'em, you can always blow 'em to Mother on high, right?"
    -   "Mother, lonely old gal, tear your heart out for what you've done."
    -   "I see your star, you left it burning for me. Mother, I'm here."
    -   "Eyes open wide, feel your heart and it's glowing."
    -   "I'll take your hand, now you'll never be lonely." 

> *The Lorn Mother gave away Her heart, and bears the [[Star of the Hearth]] in its stead.*

*Foes Shall Regenerate From Any Injury*

### Design Notes
**Icon of Micia:** The [[Star of the Hearth]] (not the cog/star of Caelondia above!)
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once each enemy has been healed.

At the end of each round, Ld6 enemies heal back to full HP.

Allies may dream the location, and status, of a creature they miss.
