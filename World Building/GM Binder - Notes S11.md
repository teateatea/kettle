### Cenobiarch Lina Raymi

What happened to:
- the Ivory Cenobium in Chesterfeld?
- Galador Grim in Chesterfeld?
- the Granite Cenobium in Phandalin?
- the Bishop of Pelor? (Alvalor Mir)

### Timeline:

- **Aug 4th (16 days ago):** The Alabaster Cenobium is burned down. Doors locked, 50% survivors (~30, down from 65)
- **Aug 6th (14 days ago):** Assassination attempt on the Cenobiarch, via "a shadow that was not stopped by light" (an invisible stalker and some shadows). Underdark visitor or targeted strike? Oni from the underdark, the Umbra Vigil ends.
- **Aug 7th (13 days ago):** The entire clergy goes into hiding. Unknown enemies, with unknown objectives and unknown abilities. 24 hour surveillance of the ruins of their cenobium.
- **Aug 10th (10 days ago):** About half of the remaining clergy (12 proper, including Justicar Cora Raymi) head into the Underdark. The Rod of Ajira is 2 days travel down.
- **Aug 16th (4 days ago):** It appears that messengers are being picked off. The half-crowns find a body, including a message from the Ivory Cenobium on Aug 9, describing a fungal blight in Chesterfeld.
- **Aug 17th (3 days ago):** The players meet Jun Oatsprig, and make an appointment to meet the Cenobiarch.
- **Aug 18th (2 days ago):** The church hires an investigator, but the players don't return to Millburn until the evening.
- **Aug 19th (yesterday):** Wanted posters go up.
- In the evening, the investigators deliver their report: Bill spent his time in the library, and Monty has been running around town like a chicken with his head cut off.
- **Aug 20th (today):** Cenobiarch Lina Raymi, and most of the remaining clergy (14 proper, ~8 service) wait on the steps of the burned church, for a morning meeting with 2 curious strangers. 

### Outline
- Cenobiarch may offer Monty absolution: His debts with the Millburns may be settled, in exchange for becoming a man of the church. He will work for the church, and by the Cenobiarch's estimate, will be absolved and a free man in 8 years time. Perhaps more, she doesn't know what other debts he owes.
- Alternatively, if he retrieves any member of the clergy from Below, or retrieves the Rod of Ajira, the church will settle his debts (with the Millburns) immediately.
- Volunteers may go. This will include Gadreth Blackwoods (healer), and Vethuda Chesk (exorcist), and possibly Priela Hefsham.
- Millburn Guards will appear quickly. They haven't seen the Cenobiarch in 2 weeks, and are eager to arrest her.
- Eternal Host Ground Captain Cescimir Voronoff, Iron Shepherd Jozilaf Risk, and a Ground Unit arrive soon after as well.
