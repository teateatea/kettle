___
Elves collect sap from trees for metals accumulated from the earth. [[Maple trees]] are popular due to their prolific sap production, but any tree sap can be used in this process.

Elves generally do not personally sow new [[Forests]], but will happily prolong the lifespans of trees in convenient locations ([[Iron Groves]], [[Silver Groves]], etc). Maintaining these groves or collecting their sap is one of the reasons elves will exit their normal boundaries, and often one of the reasons elves seem to have appeared arbitrarily.

These elven gathering parties indicate that "War is coming," but for elves soon means within the next ~500 years or so.
