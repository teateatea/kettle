# The Gods of Gods
*See also:* [[Pantheons MOC]]

![[God-Icons]]

With a fair amount of confidence, the [[The Mortal Gods|Caspian Mortal God]] [[SHO - God of Faith|SHO(Faith)]] oversees most of the Torian pantheons: namely, [[The Twelve Patron Saints of Caelon]], and the [[Ohome - Pantheon of the Halfling Slaves|Halfling Ohome]]. [[The Benefactor - Morals & Deception|The Benefactor]] and [[Brynn the Breaker]] exist as exceptions to this rule.

[[The Benefactor - Morals & Deception|The Benefactor]] serves under [[God-Icon of the Benefactor]], and therefore actually holds a similar rank to [[SHO - God of Faith|SHO(Faith)]], above the rest of [[The Twelve Patron Saints of Caelon|The Twelve]].

[[The Halfling Pantheon]] is in fact, a mundane religion, heavily bolstered by magic and [[Regimancy]]. This includes [[Brynn the Breaker]].

The [[The Mortal Gods|Caspian Mortal Gods]] serve under [[GOD-ICON - RAI-SHO-EL-HET VO-TIFA-KOA-MET|GOD-ICON RAI-SHO-EL HET]].

The [[Caspian Natural Gods]] are generally [[Spirits]] and are therefore not even technically gods. They're more like extensions of [[Nature]].

In Maroi, [[Saint Acobi]] has declared himself a god, but on this scale he's at best comparable to an [[Avatar]]. [[The Old Gods of Maroi]] serve under [[God-Icon of the Old Gods of Maroi]], but something has gone wrong.

The [[The Restless Kaghan|Restless Kaghan]] are something like a [[Curses|Curse]] mixed with [[Spirits]]. [[The Murian Bloodline]] has some ongoing magical effects, empowering their spirits to reign in regions where their dead have been buried. Their pantheon is therefore a cross between magic and [[Nature]].

[[The Elvish Pantheon]] serves [[God-Icon of the Elvish Pantheon]].

[[Dwarven Religion]] is also a mundane religion, but [[God-Icon of Dwarves]] has taken a liking to them, and so serves them fairly directly.
