# Ring of Soul-Binding
`**See also:* [[Sir Chyde]], [[Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk]]`
___

A bronze band set with a [[moonstone]], with fittings in the form of woven branches.

## The Effects of the Ring
The power of the ring of soul-binding was not thwarted by death.
- **Beyond death:** [[Sir Chyde]]'s spirit was called back from the [[The Spiritual Plane|beyond]], to linger in his [[Tomb of Saint Chyde|tomb]] as a [[phantom]]
- **Drawing together:** The [[Forlorn Tower|prison of the princess]], in [[The Fae Wild|Fairy]], and the [[Tomb of Saint Chyde|tomb of the knight]], in the [[The Material Plane|mortal world]], were [[The Faerie Reorientation|slowly drawn together]], bringing the two worlds almost close enough to touch.
- **Communion:** Even in death, the power of the ring allowed the princess and the knight to communicate verbally. They dreamed of their reunion and marriage.

### Ring of Soul-Binding
A fairy magic item that intertwines the souls of two beings.

▶ The person who possesses the ring can give it to another person, causing them to be bound. (A **save versus spells** is allowed, if unwilling.)

▶ The binding may only be undone if: the ring is destroyed, [[dispel magic]] is cast on the ring or either of the bound persons; either of the bound persons renounces the binding; the one who gave the ring dies.

#### Effects on the Bound Persons
▶ The bound persons may communicate verbally via the ring.

▶ If one of the bound persons is in the mortal world and the other in Fairy, the ring draws the two close together, narrowing the boundary between the two worlds.

▶ Upon nights of the full moon, the wearer of the ring may call the other person to them. For the space of one night, the two are united.

▶ If the wearer of the ring dies, their spirit cannot rest and will haunt the ring as a ghost. Such a ghost is only able to manifest in the presence of the ring (within 10’).
