## Combat Spells
### 1. Blackstaff - *Melee Buff*
*The caster places their sigil on a staff or cudgel, traditionally taken from a sloe.*

- The staff grants a **to-hit bonus** equal to that of a [fighter of the caster level].
- When damaging [[Enchantment Magic|enchanted creatures]], **roll damage with advantage**.

### 2 . Witchmark - *Anti-Caster Barrier or Crowd Control*
*The caster places the Witchmark on a* **threshold or a spherical object**, *vexing all casters, then completes it with their own sigil to be immune from its effects.*

##### Threshold Witchmark:
- Targets all other casters who attempt to cross the threshold.
- **Save vs Magic**, once per casting.
- The mark makes the threshold **impervious and unpassable to other casters**.

##### Spherical Object Witchmark:
*The witch rips a bite out of an apple, and throws it. The apple is dazzling and beautiful, like an iridescent disco ball.*
- Targets all other casters that can see the sphere.
- **Save vs Magic,** every round the sphere can be seen.
- For this round, **the victim is [[Enchantment Magic|enchanted]] and desperately covets the sphere.** All actions they take must bring them closer to obtaining it for themselves alone.

- Victims who consume the object immediately roll for [[Spell Catastrophe]].
	- (In a pinch, use this: ***Psychomancy:** The sorcerer falls into a deep sleep that lasts for a month and a day. During this time, all off the sorcerer's nightmares manifest in the material world. One nightmare will be spawned each night.*)


## Utility Spells
### 3. Seven Steeped Stones - *Minor Healing/Ranged Attack*
*The caster places their sigil on seven stones, then cooks them well in abundant milk.*

Each stone can be used once:
	a) **Heal 1 damage.**
	b) **Fling as a [[magic sling stone]].** *(How much damage??)*
	
As an alternative, the caster can carefully keep on cooking the milk with the stones for a day to produce a brew that grants **an extra save against disease or curse**.


### 4. Tune of the Yondkind - *Creature Detection*
*The caster hums a timeless tune, so that many beings bourne on a different dimension within earshot from the caster resonate in the specific harmony of their original sphere.*

*The tune is structured in many movements. The melody in the first movement melody shifts between different pitches, composed so that as many spheres of existence as possible can be probed in a handful of seconds.*
- This is enough to **notice the presence of the beings and their origin, but not precisely their location**.

*Each of the other movements is structured around the harmony of a specific single sphere,*
- making **creatures from that sphere identifiable by ear alone**.



## Lair Spells
### 2 . Witchmark - *Anti-Caster Barrier or Crowd Control*
*The caster places the Witchmark on a* **threshold or a spherical object**, *vexing all casters, then completes it with their own sigil to be immune from its effects.*

#### Threshold Witchmark
- Targets all other casters who attempt to cross the threshold.
- **Save vs Magic**, once per casting.
- The mark makes the threshold **impervious and unpassable to other casters**.

#### Spherical Object Witchmark
- Targets all other casters that can see the sphere.
- **Save vs Magic,** every round the sphere can be seen.
- For this round, the victim desperately covets the sphere. All actions they take must bring them closer to obtaining it for themselves alone.


### 5. Bramble Burrows - *Haven Creation*
*The spell digs a burrow under **bramble or other undergrowth**, and despite the bareness it is a safe and warm refuge.*

- The entrance is privy only to the caster's eyes, but they can guide in up to 1 person per caster level. 
- A back exit leads 1d6 miles in the direction of the caster's choice. The caster does not know exactly where the exit is, but it must be hidden by vegetation.

**Duration:** 1 day, or when the caster leaves it.
	*When the spell ends, the burrow starts to collapse.*


### 6. Watchful Head - *Alarm*
*The caster awakens the disembodied head of one of their enemies killed in combat by tracing their sigil on it while whispering in its ears awful menaces.*

The head will be watchful and report what it sees and hears when interrogated by the caster, but has scarce recollections of its previous life. It will recognize people, and **shout out an alarm if the enemies of the caster appear.**



## Curses
### 7. Wolf Witching
*The Wolf Witching is a powerful curse to have on one's home. The caster must fashion a fetish out of wolf fur, deer blood and rabbit guts, trace their sigil on it, and then incorporate some hair or blood of the victim.*

The spell becomes effective once the fetish is left, possibly hidden or buried, in the victim's home: Soon **wolves will start to roam the area**. A lone wolf the first day, two the second day and so on, until the total number of wolves attracted is
equal to the caster level.

The wolves are not automatically aggressive but have no tolerance for shenanigans.


### 8. Geas - *Curse*
**NB! Only use this if you've prepared curses for this! Danger of derailing the session.**

*The caster ensorcells a victim with a geas, a terrible malison enforcing an inescapable command.*

**The command can be to do a long or difficult task,** *like "kill Razor the Monk" or "complete the sevenfold pilgrimage" or "bring me the Globe of the Wonder-Working King from the hoard ofthe Caliph Vathek"* **or "go away".**

**Casting time:** 1 action

The target can **save to resist**, but if they fail the caster's sigil will instantly appear on them *(making this a very quick sigil spell to cast, while keeping in with the one-sigil-per-spell limit):* from then any day that is not spent fulfilling the geas will give to the victim one of the following megrims:
1) Loss of a level.
2) Loss of 1d6 stat points.
3) An incurable, evident disease: leprosy, gout, pox, porphyria, deep melancholia, etc.
4) Loss of pleasure (e.g.: all foods taste like ashes, all drinks like vinegar, not enjoy music or friends).
5) Loss of mean (e.g.: money loss, business lost, property damaged, all caused by random non-malicious events).
6) One of their close relatives or friends suffer a random megrim.

For any day that the victim works toward fulfilling the geas, one of these accrued megrims will resolve as if it never were there.

A side effect of the geas is that the victim is **empowered by the geas**: depending on the Referee they gain some power, like seeing in the dark, breathe water, or something more akin to a spell effect.
 
At any point the geas must be doable, even if it is way above the means and possibility of the victim: **should it become impossible** *(following the examples above: if Razor should die in other ways, or one of the Seven Shrines be destroyed, or the Orb suddenly explode and release the 1001 demons bound inside).* **Should the victim or the caster die,** and perchance even brought back from beyond the pale, or turned to unlife, **the geas remains in effect.**

**This spell cannot be cast more than once per moon.**
