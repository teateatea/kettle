# Hold Person
**Duration: 1 turn per level**
**Range: 120**’

This spell causes one or more humans, demihumans, or human-like monsters *(see [[OSE Persons|Persons, OSE p151]])* to be paralysed if they fail a **saving throw versus spells**. It may be cast in two ways:
1. **Against an individual:** The target’s saving throw is penalised by –2.
2. **Against a group:** 1d4 individuals in the group are targeted.

**Restrictions:** Undead and human-like monsters of greater than 4+1 HD *(see [[OSE Hit point modifiers|Hit point modifiers, OSE p150]])* are not affected.
