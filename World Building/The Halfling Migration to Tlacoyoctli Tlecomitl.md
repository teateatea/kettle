They came from the west, south of the [[The Shira Desert]] and north of The [[The Danarak Jungle]]. They stuck to the edge of the Danarak, and moved south towards the [[The Vianin Outback]].

They stopped once they reached there, occupying [[The Ferncombe|Tlacoyoctli Tlecomitl]].

North of the [[The Vianin Outback]]
East of the [[The Danarak Jungle]]
South of the [[Summerpeaks]] ([[The Phandals]] had a [[The Delian Tomb|monastery]] here.)

South-west of the [[Phandalin Fields]].


Why did they migrate?

Move this earlier, like to before the Phandals.
