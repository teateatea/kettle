# Star-nosed Mole Spirit
*See also:* [[Creatures MOC]]
___
~~It's like a [[Basilisk]] (8-legged spiky iguana), but it's swimming through the air. Ethereal.~~

It's actually a giant Star-nosed Mole spirit: The owl is just its nose, poking through to the material plane. It's a massive furry lump, with long clawed fingers. It moves like it's slowly swimming through the air. [[Petrifying Owl]]
