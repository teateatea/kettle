# Ohōme
## *Pantheon of the [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|Cotoctlaca]]*
*See also:* [ohōme - Nahuatl for "two apiece" or "two by two"](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/ohome), [[Pantheons MOC]]
___
The [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|Cotoctlaca]] developed their own pantheon within the [[Torwood]]. They took the [[The Twelve Patron Saints of Caelon]], and shifted them slightly to their own needs. *Ohome* is defined by gods who are each [bipartite](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/bipartite), *i.e.* Roathus is the patron saint of both Thirst and Plenty.

##### Design Notes
[In general, use the Bastion gods for the halfling slaves.](https://bastion.fandom.com/wiki/Gods) They call their gods "Gods", of which each is *a* god of their bipartite them, but not *the* god. 

The bad theme always comes first, Thirst *then* Plenty.

The theme of Ohome worship is *adversity* and community. Therefore, a blessing from one of these deities makes your life more difficult, so that you might become stronger. If you overcome these challenges, the deity rewards you appropriately. Praying brings on the challenge, they do not hand out free gifts.

When an enemy is affected by an Ohome blessing, the symbol in the shrine of that god appears floating over their foreheads. Only halflings can see it. Halflings only see it when the Icon made a difference, *i.e.* Acobi's chain only appears when the creature takes it additional turn.

**Does this mean only the halflings enemies, or all enemies in combat with that halfling?**

Gifts are almost always for your allies. Allies *exclude* you unless specified.
