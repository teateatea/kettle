___
[[The Great Houses of Maroi]] despise [[Saint Acobi]], but are incredibly desperate. They have agreements with [[Witches]] to begin [[Regimancy]].

Witches will use [[Geas]] to ensure the Regimancy is appropriately enacted, *usually* through violence and inconvenience to the *Maroian* houses, which greatly infuriates the great families. They do not understand regimancy.

The witches are certain they can depose Saint Acobi using their methods.
