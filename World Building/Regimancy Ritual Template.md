## The END
The goal for this ritual. Roll 1d12 or choose one below:
1. Cutting reigns short. 
2. Protecting reigns for three centuries.
3. Succession stability.
4. Breaking dynasties.
5. Ending wars.
6. Starting wars.
7. Internal strife.
8. Sowing dissent among advisors.
9. Fracturing polities into factions.
10. Outright civil war.
11. Inverting the dominant power and their vassals.
12. Major environmental effects: farming boons, plagues, ice ages, droughts, etc.

#### Setting the STAGE
The first step is Setting the Stage. This is generally paying some up from cost and signals that you are intending to perform a ritual. This step often goes unnoticed by historians and regimancers alike, because it generally does not significantly alter the course of history for the Actor (but often alters the Stranger's path instead).

THIS STEP IS THE FORCE MULTIPLIER (WEAK TO OVERBEARING.)

Performing regimancy always involves politically significantÂ acts such as:  
1. Giving bank-breakingly lavish gifts.
2. Having bastards.
3. Marrying people with the wrong background (1. nationality, 2. socioeconomic status, 3. gender, 4. heritage, 5. royalty, 6. career)
4. Breaking the succession to a seat of power
5. Oaths of fealty.
6. Breaking great oaths and treaties.
7. Declaring wars.
8. Winning battles.
9. Dying in battle.

#### Making a PLAY
The second step is Making a Play. At this point, the ritual has begun in full, and the direction of the Actor has had a marked change in the course of history.

THIS STEP DECIDES THE OVERTNESS OF THE END (SUBTLE TO STRIKING.)

# Scenes
Roll 1d4
1. Perform a Trick.
2. Propose a Gambit.
3. Collect an Ante.
4. Prepare a Ruse.

THE THIRD STEP DECIDES THE ACTUAL STRENGTH OF THE RITUAL.

THE FOURTH STEP INVOKES THE END.
## Perform a TRICK
Tricks are probably the most straight-forward Scenes to set up, giving the most control to the Actors. They are generally modest effects however.
##### The Offer
The Actor takes an action.
##### The Force
The Actor takes another action! This can be incredibly difficult for the Foe to prevent, and allows the Actor to move at their own pace.

## Propose a GAMBIT
Gambits are slightly tricky Scenes to set up, but offer some lee-way to the Actor. 

When the Actor takes an action, observant Foes do not know if it's a Trick or a Gambit. Occasionally, the Foe takes a preemptive action, thus conveniently Making the Switch. Some Foes, especially in-observant Foes, require some additional goading. The Actor must Push the Trap, until the Foe Enters the Trap.

##### The Bait
The Actor takes an action.

##### The Switch/Trap
The next step requires action by the Foe.

When the Foe chooses this of their own accord, they have Made the Switch.

When the Actor forces the Foe's hand into action, the Actor has Pushed the Trap and the Foe has Entered the Trap.


## Collect an ANTE
Antes are unusual plays, almost always set up against inobservant Foes. Antes, like Tricks, allow the Actor to Trigger the Ritual at their convenience. HoweverBecause the Foe must participate in these scenes, the effects can be moderate to strong.

##### The CALL
A common third step is Calling the Play. This requires the Foe to make some action towards the Actor, usually causing another significant change in the Actors history.

##### The RESPONSE
The Actor takes an action.

## Preparing a Ruse
Ruses are the most complicated Scenes to set up, because they require the Foe to tie their own noose, and hang themselves with it. Ruses produce the strongest effects of any scene.
#### The BURDEN
The Foe takes an Action.
#### The TAX
The Foe takes another Action. This can be difficult to achieve, especially because the Actor is often already in a compromised position.


## Add Complications
Roll 1d4 to determine the number of complications to adjust.
Roll Xd4 to determine which Means to adjust. Each Means can be adjusted multiple times.
