Pure pirates were total outlaws.

"Pirates prey upon all Mankind, and their own Species and Fellow-Creatures, without Distraction of Nations or Religions."
-Richard Allen, attorney general of South Carolina 

Privateers are state sanctioned sea robbers. Attack and seize enemy nations' merchant ships during war. Government backing. No pirates!

Corsair also have government backing, but on the basis of religion instead of nationality. Not outlaws!

Buccaneers are outlaws. They're a specific breed of pirate that was encouraged by both the French and English to harass the Spanish. Both pirate and privateers?

They influenced pirate culture , so they're relevant lol.

Population should be varied nationalities

Between 1,000 and 2,000, or approximately 15% of the navy 


The pirate ship is the most important polity.

The average pirate ship has 80 members. Up to 120-150-200 not uncommon.

Blackbeard crew had 300. Bartholomew Roberts commanded a pirate squadron of four ships with 508 men.

The average two-hundred-ton merchant ship in the early 1700s had 13-17 men.

Pirate *fleets* are a thing (37 ships, 2,000 men or 20+ vessels, or 10 ships, 960 men)

Nearly all pirates have [[Maritime Background]]:
[[Merchant Ships]], former [[Privateers]], [[Navy Seamen]].

Average age 28.2 years old (57% between 20 and 30, total range 14 - 50 years old).

Only four known female pirates.

"Pirates society was therefore energetic and testosterone filled, probably similar to a college fraternity only with peg legs, fewer teeth, and pistol duelling instead of wrestling to resolve disputes." P. 10

Pirates happily work as privateers during times of war. Shipowners took a cut, but the individual could still earn sailors a substantial sum.

But what about between wars?
Not the Navy, we're between wars. Staff cuts to 25%.

[[Merchant Ships]] pays half as much (£12-£25) as privateers and navy. (£15-£33)

In times of peace, Privateers keep pirating 

"Privateers in Time of War are a Nursery for Pyrates against a Peace." P12


One lucky loot earns pirates can about 40 years of working merchant ships.

£1 = $266 current American 

£1,000 per member aka $266,000.

£500-£3,000 happened.

More modest common.
