# Torian Spies
*See also:* [[Torian Military & Combat]], [[The Schola Arcana - The Torian School of the Arcane]], [[Divination Wizards (Tor)]], [[Spies]]
___
I don't think the Schola Arcana as a whole would be overly concerned with spying. [[Divination Wizards (Tor)]] would be a subset of all wizards, and are likely each contracted regularly by the [[City-States of Tor]], but are not on permanent retainer.

Instead, these are probably mundane spies. [[Thieves Guilds]]. Rogues who will pay for information.
