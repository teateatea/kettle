Approx 600 years ago, it was a [[The Phandals|Phandal]] refuge from [[The Death of the Phandals]]. [[Southern Elves in Torwood]] allow it, fuck the dwarves for doing this to you.

The old name was the Burning Mills, but in Phandal lexicon idk.

Significant logging enterprise, the entirety of the Southern [[Torwood]] has been processed.
