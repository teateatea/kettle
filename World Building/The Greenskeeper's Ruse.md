## The END 
The goal for this ritual:
Steal all farming boons from the Foe to the Actor's lands.

#### Setting the STAGE
The Actor must win three consecutive battles, against three different Agents. One of these will become the Foe. Each battle must occur during the day, and must occur during the spring or summer (technically, must occur on top of plants). The losses incurred by the Actor sets the Multiplier for the ritual (more losses = more multiplier).

#### Making a PLAY
The second step is Making a Play. At this point, the ritual has begun in full, and the direction of the Actor has had a marked change in the course of history.
C

1. Giving bank-breakingly lavish gifts.

The Actor must choose one of the Humbled as the Foe. The Actor must bless the Foe lavish Gifts, which must now live with the Foe. The quantity of lives living amongst the Foe sets the overtness of the ritual (more livs = more striking)


THIS STEP DECIDES THE OVERTNESS OF THE END (SUBTLE TO STRIKING.)

# Scenes
Roll 1d4
1. Perform a Trick.
2. Propose a Gambit.
3. Collect an Ante.
4. Prepare a Ruse.

THE THIRD STEP DECIDES THE ACTUAL STRENGTH OF THE RITUAL.

THE FOURTH STEP INVOKES THE END.

## Preparing a Ruse
Ruses are the most complicated Scenes to set up, because they require the Foe to tie their own noose, and hang themselves with it. Ruses produce the strongest effects of any scene.
#### The BURDEN

5. Oaths of fealty.

The Foe takes an Action. The Foe must ally with a Stranger. The Strength of the Stranger sets the Strength of the Ritual.


#### The TAX
The Foe must lose their head of power, and relinquish their seat to the Fool, chosen only briefly before their rise. Inkoves the End.


4. Breaking the succession to a seat of power

The Foe takes another Action. This can be difficult to achieve, especially because the Actor is often already in a compromised position.
