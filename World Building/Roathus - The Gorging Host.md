### Design Notes
**Icon of Roathus:** A leaf, or a leafy olive branch.
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once each enemy deals damage. 

Enemy damage denies healing. Creatures damaged by this enemy cannot benefit from magical healing until sunrise. It fees like there's a ghostly hand around the location of the damage.

Allies double the sustenance gained from eating food. This generally means they are sated, and no longer hungry.
