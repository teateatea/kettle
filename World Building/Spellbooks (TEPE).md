Spellbooks are personal cue sheets for [[Maroian Magicians|Magicians]], each page holding the [[Spellforms (TEPE)|spellforms]] necessary for [[Spell Preparation (TEPE)|preparing spells.]]

They are incredibly valuable to Magicians, and are almost never just mundane books. It's reasonable to assume all Magicians' spellbooks include these common features:
- Resistance to water & fire.
- Magical protections against wear and tear during travel (friction, sunlight, humidity)
- Locks keeping the book shut.

Less ubiquitous features include:
- Traps for opening the book
- Traps for reading the wrong page
- Traps for preparing the wrong spell
