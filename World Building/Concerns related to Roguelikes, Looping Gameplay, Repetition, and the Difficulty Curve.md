## Part 1: Rolling of the Dice
[[Roguelikes need randomization to prevent boredom]]
[[Looping Gameplay quickly becomes uninteresting if they repeat like clockwork]]

## Part 2: Power Creep
[[Roguelikes use permadeath]]
[[Avoid permanent progress made across roguelike runs]]
[[If you must have permanent progress in your roguelike, adjust difficult on the fly]]

## Part 3: Under Pressure
[[Roguelikes have Pressure]]
[[Always Add Pressure]]

## Part 4: Split Personality
[[Force players to interact with different portions of the game]]

## Part 5: Playing with yourself

## Part 6: Ending It
Planning and stuff.
