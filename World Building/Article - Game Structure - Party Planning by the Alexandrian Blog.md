# Game Structure: Party Planning by the Alexandrian

The structure can be broken down into four tools: The location, the guest list, the main event sequence, and the topics of conversation.

# Location
*Where is the social event taking place?*

There needs to be a lot of different areas that the party can move between, so avoid making the location too small, or too simple:
- You want multiple zones of activity, so that social groups can form and break apart freely.
- You don't want PCs to be simultaneously engaged with every single NPC at the event (that's a board meeting or rally or something).

3-5 locations is good.

They can be in view of eachother as long as they're distinct areas that people can congregate in (e.g. dance floor, bar, and VIP area).

At least one private area is good, because slipping in or out of them invokes intrigue.

# Guest List
First, you’ll want to prep a master list of names that you can use as a quick reference while running the event.

Next, you’ll want to prep each of these important NPCs using the [[NPC Template]]. The template will let you quickly pick up each NPC and slip into their role during the event.

**KEY INFO**: The _Key Info_ section of the roleplaying template is designed for scenario-essential information that is crucial for the GM to remember when using the NPC. When using the template for a social event, this can include:

- The character’s relationship with or attitude towards other NPCs. (“Despises Susannah.” or “Will enjoy swapping war stories with the naval officers.”)
- Specific reactions that they might have to stimuli. (“Is angered by anyone suggesting that her father is dying.”)
- Particular actions or interactions that should be triggered. (“Will try to poison Cassandra’s drink.” or “Wants to sell the PCs timeshares in Venice Beach.”)
- Clues that can be gleaned from them. (“Knows the knife belonged to Cassandra.” or “Perception check (DC 20) to notice that her dress has been torn.”)
- Scenario hooks.
- Cross-references or common experiences that they share with particular PCs. (“Was raised in the same orphanage as Bella.” or “Was a friend to the duke they killed in session 3.”)
- Unusual or important gear they might be carrying. (“Her glass eye allows her to see through walls.” or “The golden cross she wears is made of aurum (true gold).”)

Obviously some of these categories overlap with each other, and there are plenty of other essential details that will be scenario- or character-specific.

# Main Events
Prep situations, not story lines.

Usually a linear sequence (A happens, then B happens, the C happens).
Could be a random table. [Second track](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8197/roleplaying-games/advanced-node-based-design-part-4-the-second-track) is mystery or complicated!
# Topics of Conversation
What can be more useful is figuring out two or three different _general_ viewpoints on a particular topic (supporting the new Ironworkers’ Guild vs. thinking it’s a front for criminal activity), and then you can just have each NPC _ad lib_ within that debate.

# Running the Party
What happens in the first moment when the PCs show up for the event?

Vary the interactions (some NPCs go to the PCs, let PCs walk up to others).
