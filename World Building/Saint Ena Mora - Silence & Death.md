>
> Won't you take me to the Silent Sea?
>

>
> Won't you take me to the Silent Sea?
>

___
- **Funeral Spires, Cremation, Last Words, Last Rites:** The dead are cleaned and wrapped, then placed inside cremation spires, which range from simple wooden bonfires to elaborate towers. The appearance of the spire doesn't technically matter, but the living tend to build the nicest spire they can afford.
- These serve two functions for the dead: First, fire can be seen across the Veil, and followers of Ena Mora know to draw near a burning spire once they've crossed into the Spiritual Plane. This is the time for the living to speak the last words to the dead (and listen for the last words of the dead).
- Second, their physical bodies will become ashe, so their spirits will not try to claw their way back through the Veil to reach the recognizable. They might recognize other thing through the Veil, but one's own body is usually the most personal and comforting sight in the unfamiliar plane, and many spirits have trouble abandoning their bodies.
- **Spireships:** Next, the ashes are taken to be scattered upon the sea. This is done by the priests of Ena Mora, and is afforded to all followers. Often, family or loved ones will travel with the priests to the sea, but this carries costs that the Church of Ena Mora does not subsidize.

### Worship
___
- **Prayers:**
- **Funerals:**
- **Celebration of the Dead:**



## The Spiritual Plane

Upon death, souls immediately cross the Veil into the Spiritual Plane. This plane is separated from the Material Plane by only a small distance, so there is overlap and the possibility of interaction.



Torians are taught by priests of Ena Mora to call upon the Lady Most Fair to guide them to the Silent Sea. They'll journey to the coast, and set out upon her vessel, where they'll need to take a vow of silence before joining their kin in eternal rest beneath the waves.

However, not all souls go to the Silent Sea. The Spiritual Plane and the Material Plane are closely tied, and there are several implications imposed upon the dead.



- Souls can access the Material Plane, but only through a veil: It's difficult to see, difficult to hear, and the passage of time is very difficult to gage.

- The Spiritual Plane is not inherently safe. While most of the dead do not hold any particular ill-will towards others, there are terrors and nightmares keen on ingesting and absorbing their more placid kin.

- Ghosts (in the Material Plane) are souls that have been lost for too long. They don't understand the Spiritual Plane, and try to claw their way back through the Veil to something familiar in the Material Plane. They are almost always emotional (scared, angry, sad), because the calm don't claw back through in a panic.

- Many beings are very different when they arrive in the Spiritual Plane. The Material Plane emphasizes physical materials, while the Spiritual Plane focuses on energy. This means that very emotional or energetic beings are empowered here, even if they were small in stature in life.

 ## Resurrection
Magic that raises the dead is risky if you care about the results. If you are a Torian who expects to be resurrected, you must do several things while in the Spiritual Plane.
- You must not call upon Saint Ena Mora to lead you to safety. Once you take the vow of silence, you cannot answer a resurrection.
- You must stay as near to your material body as you can, so that you can be the first to answer the call when it comes. Occasionally, a closer soul might breach the Veil instead of you, which is always disconcerting to the living.
- If your body is moved, you must do your best to follow it. While all space in the Material Plane seems to have a corresponding space in the Spiritual Plane, *distance* is not compared at a consistent rate. Therefore, when the living move a body, the dead must be extremely vigilant if they wish to follow it. There is no beacon towards your own body (although some magicians claim to have tools otherwise).
- You must avoid and survive any unfamiliar and treacherous company that might hunt you. There is no guarantee that you will survive until the resurrection takes place.
- You must do all of this for an infinite amount of time, because time does not pass in the same way for the dead. It might take just one day for a cleric reach your body, but that might be a minute or a decade to the dead. It is not yet known how to accurately measure time in the Spiritual Plane from the Material Plane (or vice versa).
- You must pray that you actually will be resurrected. There are those who were *told* they would be resurrected, only for promises to be broken. Those souls will endure an infinite struggle, waiting for a summons that will never come.
