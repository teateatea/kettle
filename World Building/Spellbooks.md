- When Torian Wizards prepare out of a spellbook, that spell becomes unusable to *all* Magic-Users.

## [[Torian Wizards]]
Spellbooks are arcane menagerie-prisons, a stable full of bound creature-spells. The animals are re-energized each dawn. *(Advanced users note that the anima often return earlier than dawn.)*

## [[Maroian Magicians]]
The House Maroi [[Spellbooks|spellbook]] has the Hollow Knight Path of Pain seal symbol on the front of it. Use midnight blue and gold, or dark blood red and gold at advanced levels.

The spells written in spellbooks help put your mind into the right trance to hold a transient mental geometry in your consciousness long enough to manipulate some essence.
