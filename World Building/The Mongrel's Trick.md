## DM Interpretation
A major family member marries a stranger with the wrong nationality. The multiplier of this ritual is set by how much this annoys the minor families. Really annoyed means a stronger effect.

One of the betrothed must die in battle with the foe. The overtness of the ritual is set by how heartbroken the survivor is. More heartbroken means a more sudden effect.

The survivor must have a bastard, and put them ahead of every legitimate heir. The more this bastard pisses everyone off, the stronger the ritual will be.

To bring an *immediate* end to a war, the King marries an unpopular tramp. She dies in battle, and the King is inconsolable. He has a bastard now, and declares the bastard heir to the throne. This pisses off everybody. The Bastard wins a battle, the enemy quickly routes, surrenders, and the bastard is declared a war hero by the people.
