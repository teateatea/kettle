## 1. Place, History or People
Firstly, place names most often tell us something about a central geographical feature, but they can also refer to important historical events, or the people living there themselves. Which geographical features, historical events, and the descriptors given also tell us about what the people value culturally. Consider creating a lexicon of those base terms like 'forest' in the regional language.

Forest, River, Hill, Valley, Farm, Castle, Village.
Battle, Loss, Victory, Slaughter, Landing, Conquest, (Story, Myth if major culture site).
Always things they care about (aka mountains for land people, vs river crossings for canoe people.)


## 2. Change, Simplification & Evolution
Secondly, place names change across history as the language evolves, speakers simplify the name, segments of the name get conflated with other terms, or people add modifying words to help define the name when it gets confused. Consider how the words in your lexicon may have changed or variants that may have developed.

Take the above step through one or more steps here:
**Language evolution:** The dominant language in the region changes. Lake > Lark etc.
**Simplification:** removing extra modifiying words like of the on around. Remove or combine syllables that are hard to pronounce (especially for dominant language.)
**Conflation:** Similar sounds or words become conflated, bleeding into use with one another. 
**Elaboration:** Adding modifiers to distinguish places from others with similar names. Upper, Lower, Greater, Lesser, North, etc.

## 3. Power (Change of power/politics/conquest etc)
Thirdly, which place names are recorded, survive, and are used is also about who is in power and what the city means to them. Endonyms are names given by those who live there, exonyms are given by outsiders. This is particularly common in colonised regions. Consider mapping out where linguistic groups hold power and using important geopolitical sites to demonstrate this powerspread.

## 4. History?
Fourthly, where the linguistic traits - such as syntax, grammar, words, or emphasis on a place, event, or people - of a particular ethnogroup can be found tell us about which groups live there or did so historically. Consider mapping out where linguistic groups are, have been, or have travelled through and use linguistic traits from those groups to show this.
