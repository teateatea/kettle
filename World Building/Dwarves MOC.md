# Dwarves
*See also:* [[Classes MOC]]
___
Dwarves hate Torians. There's been a war for at least 200 years (but the last battle was 100 years ago.) The dwarves call this a skirmish with men.

They'll trade with [[Capitol]] though, [[Saint Acobi]] has enough power that they respect him (plus he's had a decent amount of staying power "recently" - 75 years.)

They infrequently are found in Caspia, often as refugees
