The Drune
The Drune are a cult of sorcerers who
jealously guard the stone circles and
ley lines of Dolmenwood. Common
folk are terrified of their occult machinations—
including kidnappings and
rumours of human sacrifice—and fear
to speak their name. They are not to
be meddled with.

They use [[2 The Whything Stones]] magical runes [[Shamen (Murian Magic)]]?

The owl is a symbol of the Drune.
