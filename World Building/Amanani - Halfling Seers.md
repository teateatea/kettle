Counter-spies worked for the [[The Old Halfling King]] during [[The Golden Age of Tlecomitl]], and presented their results to [[The Old Halfling Council]], including [[The Court Historian that betrayed his people]]. They were the ones who noted the [[Elvish Rebalancing]], though this was obviously not public knowledge.

Halflings probably don't have any major Spy organization. Their spies are really counter-spies, emphasis on defense.
