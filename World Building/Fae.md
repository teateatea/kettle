## Fairies
Those races whose members originate in the undying realm of Fairy, are collectively known as *fairies*. The vast majority of fairies never cross the subtle threshold that separates their realm from the mortal world (and indeed would never dream of doing so). However, some individuals do enter the mortal world, upon occasion, and some even gain a taste for the place and tarry for extended periods.

The fairies who may be encountered in [[The Dolmenwood|Dolmenwood]] are typically those of unusual bent (romantics, obsessives, or megalomaniacs), or those who have been outcast from their native realm.
