*Foes Shall Have Vengeance in the Throes of Defeat*

### Design Notes
**Icon of Acobi:** A single red-hot chain-link.
**Reveal** this combat begins. Shackles with chains snake around their wrists, red-hot from a fire.
**Remove** it when they are reduced to 0 HP the second time.

When reduced to 0 HP, enemies are instead reduced to 1 HP. On their next turn, they must attack the Halfling, or the Party if unable. At the end of their next turn, they take 1 damage. 

Allies (including minions) gain +1 to hit.
