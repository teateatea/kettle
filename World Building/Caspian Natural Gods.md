The Gods of Nature govern all things beyond Mortals. They are many, and are a diverse set of overseers. Usually, these gods watch over land and all that happens within that land, with varying jurisdictions and strengths. Lakes can have gods, seas can have gods, forests can have gods, groves can have gods. Not all land has a natural god, but there's something special happening if a region *does* have a god.

Natural gods may have relationships with Mortal gods. A volcanic region may be said to be visited by VO(Pensiveness) during quiet periods, or a forest god may have bickered with EL(fear), HET(surprise) and KOA(anger) during a forest fire.
