# R1-05 Overgrown Passage
*See also:*
___
Overgrown jungle [nearly impassable, infinite], crystal
frogs [jewelry, hungry for clockwork], pale roots [cords
throughout, basement stairs [[RB - The Bathhouse Ruins (Basement)]]]

The jungle has grown furiously without clockwork bugs
maintaining it. Pale roots push out from the basement [[RB - The Bathhouse Ruins (Basement)]]
stairs (in the restroom) to create a tangled carpet under
the thick brush. Although the passageway still guides
visitors back to the path, all the tiles have been
swallowed up, and getting lost is very likely. Any
visible sky progresses through each day at twice the
normal speed, and no longer adjusts based on location.

NB: Recommend list of rare plants, including pale roots from
The Plant.
