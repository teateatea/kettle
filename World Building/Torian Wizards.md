## Tor
Torians describe a Wizard as "someone who studies magic". They are all generally working under a college (research grants are a huge deal), with significant sponsorship and subsidies from the state. 

## Class
You're a wizard! The basis of your magic is the [[Principia Arcana]]. You've probably studied at the most advanced school for this paradigm, the [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)|Schola Legio Arcana]] in [[Phandalin]].

**Consistency:** *Themes and appearance.*

**Source:** Spells from the [[Old School Essentials]] [[Classic Fantasy rules magic list]], and [[Magical Industrial Revolution]] (roll both generic and unique).

---

**[[Spells]]:** [[Spells are animals|Spells are animals]]  (_"animus"_).

**[[Spellbooks]]:** Spellbooks are arcane menagerie-prisons, a stable full of bound creature-spells. The animals are re-energized each dawn. _(Advanced users note that the anima often return earlier than dawn.)_

**[[Spell Preparation]]:** 
You bind the _anima_ to your soul, usually temporarily. Some spells can become permanent extensions of your soul (aka [[Cantrips]]), but these are usually very docile _anima_.

**[[Spell Slots]]:** How many _animus_ can you bind to your [[Souls|soul]]]? Without losing control of all the creatures, of course. *(Or losing your soul.)*

**[[Overcasting]]:** Basically impossible. How would you produce anima from nothing!?

But [[Overpreparing]]? Yes. Too many spells bound to your soul might result in Magical Industrial Revolution [[Spell Catastrophe|Spell Catastrophes]] *Make this only for the initial casting, while too many are prepared. Crank the power up too.*

---

**[[Learning Spells]]:** Not really a thing. You can become familiar with an _anima_, or learn to manage several at once, but that's about it. You don't "learn rats" like you "learn french". You learn _about_ rats, or maybe about a particular rat.

**[[Transferring Spells|Moving/Transfering Spells]]:** Relatively straight forward. Might require the creation of an appropriate container, but otherwise just requires the rebinding an _anima_ to the new container.

**[[Duplicating Spells|Copying/Duplicating Spells]]:** Breeding _animus_ is a difficult and dangerous process, but possible. Duplicating a single _anima_ is as unfathomable as having a child by yourself.

**[[Spell Scrolls]]:** Are reusable if you're worth your salt, but can be little delicate for adventuring life (weather, travel, fire, etc).

---

**[[Binding Enchantments]]:** Notoriously difficult. You need to somehow construct an open cage that also doesn't let the _anima_ just escape. The item basically acts as both a prison for the _anima_ and an external soul-intermediary for the wizard. They basically always recharge if you've done it right though. Generally requires attunement.

**[[Inventing New Magic]]:** Breeding anima is difficult and dangerous, but possible. Sometimes mutations happen in useful ways. Often they explode.

## The Wizard's Perspectives
### [[Maroian Magicians]]
Maroi wizards appear to duplicate _anima_ in impossible ways, especially out of their spell books. They've even been rumoured to produce spell-like effects with no _animus_ at all.

The Maroi can bind enchantments in ways that you cannot, and their artifacts rarely even require attunement. They are surprisingly good at producing spell scrolls, but this is likely due to the fact they nearly always [[Spell-crush|spell-crush]] them.

They seem quite unskilled at moving _anima_ from one container to another, as if they can only do it under perfect conditions, when they're in the right mood.

Their "theory" seems absurdly abstract, and most of the magical innovations they get excited about only ever seem to happen in quiet libraries or research towers.

---

### [[Caspian Maestros]]
Caspian [[Sorcerers]] are even more inexplicable. They spend an inordinate amount of time engaging with each _animus_, but then have no apparent limit to number of _anima_ that can be permanently bound to their souls. (Confusingly, the total output of a sorcerer still seems comparable to that of a Wizard, instead of limitless.)

It should be noted that those permanent _anima_ appear to grow in strength as their hosts do. Take caution when engaging with previously encountered sorcerers: their _anima_ are absolutely not stagnant.

However, they unnecessarily perceive strict limits related to the use of _anima_ from identical species or even similar categorizations. "Only once per day," they claim, even if _animus_ siblings are clearly available. Perhaps their doctrine holds these limits sacred.

They show little understanding of the importance of sustainable storage for an _animus,_ and are entirely unable to produce artifacts.

## External Perspectives
##### Maroi's Perspective on Wizards
Maroians usually call [[Torian Wizards|Torian magic users]] "Magicians", because most if not all of them do work under their college, which is technically sponsored by the state. Wizards find this annoying, because they are independent actors and do not take direct orders from anyone. 

It's the difference between Pirates and Privateers: They do similar activities, but Pirates are free-thinking pioneers and Privateers are bulldogs on leashes.

It's the difference between a wolf and a guard dog: One is a sovereign agent who secures their territory, and the other is a leashed beast protecting its masters property.
