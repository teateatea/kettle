[[Maroian Wayfinding Spell]]

There's a network of large multisided inside cubes placed around Maroi. Casting a spell sends a flare upwards, that bursts into a magic radar. The flare then shoots straight back down, burning a circle into the ground. Several lines indicate directions to the various signal points, and directions to the various points.
