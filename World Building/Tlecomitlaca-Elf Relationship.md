# Tlecomitlaca-Elf Relationship
## Free Halfling Relationship with the Elves
*See also:* [[Cotoctlaca-Elf Relationship]]
___
The [[Elves MOC]] call the [[The Cotoctlaca - Halfling Slaves in Tor|Cotoctlaca]] 'pikku paskaa' (πίκκο πασκαα (Finnish-Greek) ) meaning "little betrayers" (with an additional connotation of "little shits"). Elves initially defended their [[Iron Groves]], but have temporarily retreated. They consider [[The Torwood War]] this war unfinished, having ended a scant 200 years ago. (It's like it ended 10 years ago.)

Elves see Cotoctlaca as child-soldiers. Incredibly upsetting in theory, even worse when they're used against you. Should you kill a child? Do they even have free will?

But things become complicated when the child-soldiers all grow up, and have their own kids. Do *those* people have free will? [[Elvish Spies|Elves could not understand]] why their cousins (another race with [[Fae Ancestry]]) would fight against them, nor [[The Halfling Cripple's Ante#CALL the Play|why they'd be interested in joining Men]].

Regardless, Elves went out of their way to avoid Halfling casualties. They intentionally brought [[Swords that age the victim instead of cutting them]] to literally halve the effects of their raids against halfling defenders. They gave Halflings a token of mercy during war, undeserving or not.

Elves will never reveal this small mercy, they fear showing weakness to the Men. They have seen how Men treat those they think are weak (animals, plants, lands).


The [[Tlecomitlaca - The Free Halflings|Tlecomitlaca]] are simply 'lasten lapset' (λάστην λάπσετ) or "the children of children" to them. Elves recognize that these are a different people, but very pointedly keep them at arms length. (In America during WWII, the Japanese were treated quite poorly despite having no direct connections to the war.)

If you are an Elf, you consider it to be incredibly graceful to simply ignore all halflings now. They seem petulant, and expect you to apologize for the crimes of defending sacred Elvish woods? 

___

The [[Tlecomitlaca - The Free Halflings|Tlecomitlaca]] are livid that the [[Elves MOC]] slaughtered their people. They'll be casually racist against Elves in general (the way the Japanese can be deeply racist to black people).

If you are Tlecomitlaca, 7 generations ago, the Elves slaughtered your cousins and shat on their corpses. They've given zero shits about halflings for 300 years since: they don't show remorse, no apologies, no PR. How do you feel about that?
