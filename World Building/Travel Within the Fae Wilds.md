The height of the sun is related to location, and longitude (from east to west). Travelling approximately westwards most the sun forwards in time, eastwards goes backwards in time. But to perfectly move the sun along it's usual course, one would need to plot sine-wave route across the Feywild, not a straight line.

Most direction aregiven using *time* descriptors and *relative positioning*, rather than *cardinal directions* or *absolute directions.* For example, rather than saying "Head west to the castle. When you see the mountains, head north.," a faery would say "Head morning-wise to the castle. When see the sun rise over the crested peaks, turn and keep the sunrise on your left."

## At the Edges of the Fae Wild
If one travels far enough through the day to reach an entirely new day, one would leave the Fae Wild and cross into the [[The Gardens of Ynn|Gardens of Ynn]].

## At the Center of the Fae Wilds
If you travel to the exact center of the Fae Wilds, you'll find the [[Noon King]]'s keep. In the center of the keep is a library. In the center of the library is a door, to the [[The Stygian Library|Stygian Library]].
