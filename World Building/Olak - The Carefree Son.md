### Design Notes
**Icon of Olak:** A colourful pinwheel, spinning gently.
**Reveal** this when the combat begins.
**Remove** it once each enemy has become ethereal.

When combat begins, 1d6 enemies immediately become ethereal for one round.

Enemies have an L-in-6 chance of become ethereal each round. Ethereal enemies appear ghostly, and cannot deal or receive damage for one round.

Once during the duration of this gift, allies may reroll any one die after seeing the result.
