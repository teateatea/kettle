*You've probably heard this as a children's cautionary tale: "Don't walk alone in winter, or the Cold Prince might catch you!"*
```

## The Death of Sir Chyde
The knight was slain in the final battle of mortal and fairy on the hills of the [[High Wold]].

- **Dying wish:** Sir Chyde insisted on being interred in a tomb deep in the forest.
- **The fate of the Lady:** She was never seen again. Some say she died in the depths of the forest, in the glade where she and her love first met.
