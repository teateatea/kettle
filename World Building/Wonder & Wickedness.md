##### Spell Duration
Unless otherwise stated, the durations of all spells are equal to the sorcerer's level in exploration turns.

In most games, an â€œexploration turn" is equal to approximately 10 minutes of in-game time, though I personally prefer to keep such measurements abstract and somewhat elastic.

I often further simplify tracking durations by ending ongoing effects when the random encounter check die comes up 5 rather than bothering to track durations exactly.
