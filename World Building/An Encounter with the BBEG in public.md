> If you are trying to give your BBEG a little more flavor, I have a fun solution for messing with your players morality and adding in a layer of hatred for the villain.
> 
> Public confrontations. When you get to the point where the players have figured everything out, reveal that your bad guy has been doing just as much homework as these adventurers. He has quietly taken some of their most precious family members, treasures, etc... While they've been trying to figure out him and his plot. When they have their moment of revelation, the BBEG gets them into a town. This can be done by showing a small bit of proof that he has a meaningful hostage, such as a private present, or even a piece of them (make sure the players are okay with this level of violence) left in plain view.
> 
> Now the fun begins. When they get into the middle of this busy town, simply have your BBEG walk up to them, and begin quietly goading them into aggressive acts. Get them riled up by describing some of the evil deeds that have befallen their hostages, or things that will happen when the villain leaves. If you can get them to publicly attack or cause a scene, have guards and helpful bystanders come to the BBEG's side, not knowing any better. In other words, have them villainize the party publicly.
> 
> I find that this adds a large depth of emotion and hatred for the bad guy. To take it a step further, if your players are okay with impactful and saddening moments, then you might try pulling an "Ozymandias", and have it so that the BBEG has already done these horrible acts, before even confronting the party. Bonus points if he is a necromancer or the like, and raises the dead loved ones to fight the adventurers.

> There's an interaction my DM used in Curse of Strahd that I might use in some facet that dives into this.

> > SPOILERS:
> > When you first go to Castle Ravenloft for the dinner invite, my DM had us sit down with five people that had bags over their heads. One by one throughout each course of the dinner, he'd pull a bag off and reveal someone that one of us knew to try and get us pissy. They were bound and gagged. Of course, Strahd is playing mind games and wants information so our party does just that: We tell him the timeline of things we did and, if he was satisfied, moved onto the next person.
> > 
> > The last two, however, he yanked off at the same time and the people's throats were slit and they fell forward onto the table. Strahd makes a grand exit turning into bats and disappears. At that point, all five of those figures disappear as they were illusions. We don't know if he actually has possession of them or if he had just been doing homework on us. Either way, it was a fantastic session.
> I'm not sure how huge I am on using stuff from other modules but I have all new players and they're vested in the campaign. I can change it up to an extent so it's not 100% similar, but I also don't know if this was just the DM's flavoring or if it was actually in the module

> This gets more and more evil as you read through it.

> I do like the idea of the public smack down though. It can be really difficult for the party to have a meaningful connection with the BBEG if they are busy in a lair/dungeon somewhere. Send out a simulacrum to mess with them and make them lose face.

> There are so many little variations you can toss in to make it even better. Maybe your BBEG is a complete sociopath, so after goading them into attacking, he hits a mental switch and starts crying for help, dealing 1 point of bludgeoning to himself, in an effort to cause noticeable damage. You know, in order to garner sympathy from guards.
