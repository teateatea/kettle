## The Question of Classification
The Question of Classification has consumed the theoretical magic community for a generation. The former system of eight “Grand Schools” ([[Abjuration Magic|Abjuration]], [[Conjuration Magic|Conjuration]], [[Divination Magic|Divination]], [[Enchantment Magic|Enchantment]], [[Evocation Magic|Evocation]],
[[Illusion magic|Illusion]], [[Necromancy Magic|Necromancy]], and [[Transmutation Magic|Transmutation]]), a system that fit so neatly into [[The Grand Schools of Magic|The Eight Fold Paradigm]] ([[Magical Industrial Revolution|MIR pg.69]]), suffered several esoteric but devastating blows:
- Transmuting base metals was shown to be a property of raw magic. 
- A huge number of spells were proven to be minor variants on force plate.
- [[Illusionist Wizards (Tor)|Illusionists]] wrested light-magic away from Evocationists, who in turn split into Elementalists and a bewildering array of sub-factionalists.

In the absence of a universally accepted system, tempers run high. Prof. Grantos the Blue and Prof. Curitan fought a duel over whether dancing lights should be classified as an Illusion or an Evocation. At a faculty dinner, a visiting lecturer was heard to shout, “If cure wounds is Necromancy then I am a jackass!” to which another guest sarcastically replied, “Pray ma’am, we are not discussing polymorph at
this time.”

The table above covers all spells separately identified by the [[College of Endon]]. Spells in the same row share the same “family”, in increasing potency or sophistication from left to right. Spells are further divided by “blocks” and “schools”. The placement of any given spell on this table is subject to considerable debate and future revision. Some spells are given in a general sense (e.g. detect covers detect magic, detect traps, detect gold, etc.)

Hedge Magic covers all spells that don’t fit into any other school or whose placement is so controversial that they can’t safely be assigned a school without endless fights.

Nothing in this table affects practical wizards, who will cheerfully reference spell-tables a century out of date... or a few decades ahead of the curve.
