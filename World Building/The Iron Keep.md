# The Iron Keep
*See also:* #Fort
___
A forward outpost at the southern edge of the [[The Redridge Mountains]].

Built 385 - 370. Completed in the 25th year of Good King Omen.

[[Tor MOC]] fought [[Dwarves MOC]] (beginning ~400 years ago) over the iron in the Redridge (because [[Tor has poor metals reserves]]). The Iron keep allowed them to access the iron-rich [[Shattered Canyons]].

Southwest of the [[Shattered Canyons]]

[[Good King Omen]] was looking for the [[Dwarven Portal to Chaos and Fire]] in the [[Shattered Canyons]]. He found it.
