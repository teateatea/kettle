## Maroi
Maroians call people who study magic "Magicians," and they are assumed to always be [[endorsed by a great house]]. There are infrequently "[[Rogue Magicians]]", but they are generally employed by the military and not strictly speaking completely without patron.




# House Maroi

You're a magician! You probably learned to invoke magic using the [[Theory of Essencial Potential Energy]] at the [[House Maroi]] in [[Capitol]].

---

**Consistency:** Use [[Hollow Knight]] Symbols as a general rule. The House Maroi [[Spellbooks|spellbook]] has the Hollow Knight Path of Pain seal symbol on the front of it. Use midnight blue and gold, or dark blood red and gold at advanced levels.

**Source:** Spells from the [[Old School Essentials]] [[Classic Fantasy rules magic list]], and [[OSE-adjacent Desks & Dragons rewrite]].

## Other Magic Users from the Magicians Perspective
### [[Torian Wizards]]
Torian Magicians are a compassionate bunch. They describe spell geometries as though they are pets or beasts. "We spell-bind the _animus,"_ they say, with great concern for "its" well-being.

This somehow lets them reproduce rituals with ease, or even draw new rituals that produce identical geometries. Annoyingly, however, they somehow break the original ritual in this process, so take care not to share your spellbook with a magician.

They have great trouble creating artifacts, but when they do, their artifacts produce apparently infinite charges (albeit at a slow rate). Confusingly, this is only accessible to those who treat the artifact with great care.

The magician can only seem to pull one spell from each ritual written in a spellbook, and is baffled by the idea of skipping the spellbook to spontaneously output arcane essence.

Their "principle" is an art at best. Arcane innovations for the Torians are always suprises to them, the result of endless trial and error, with few intentional discoveries.

## [[Caspian Maestros]]
Caspian [[Sorcerers]] are... incomprehensible. They do not require the manipulation of essencial charges into spell forms. They claim to be directly (physically!) producing alternative forms to pour their essence into, and are able to retain a full understanding of the form even after they have been cast.

They have even greater limitations than the magicians do, allowing themselves only a single casting of any instance of a spell each day. Their limitation does not stem from lesser essencial charge quality (which appears to be identical to ours), but instead from a religious convent instead.

Sorcerers seem to be almost entirely unable to use physical items in their pursuit of magic. They are barely able to use spell scrolls, they leave their spellbooks behind when travelling, and they have little interest in the intricacies of artifact enchantment.

## Tor's Perspective on Magicians.
Torians call magicians "Wizard" instead. "One who invokes magic." Magicians find this mildly annoying, like describing an Painter as a Paint Mixer or a Studier of Paint. *We do technically mix paint, but you're really missing the big picture here.*

## Caspian Perspective on Magicians
Caspians call most Magicians "Disciples." "Someone who is learning magic", because most Magicians still carry around their spell books. Only initiates need to carry around their spellbooks in Caspia.

Well-travelled Magicians understand this as a mild insult (unless they're actual initiates), but most Magicians do not realize that "Disciple of Magic" suggests they lack skill (they should prefer to be "Maestro of Magic" by level 2 and by level 3 it's a straight insult lol.)

Magicians consider "Disciple of Magic" to be true, but vague and a rather foreign to describe what they do. It's like calling a Painter as a "Student of Art."
