___

### [[Discipline A Abilities| A.]] Formation
You gain +1 AC for each adjacent ally.

### [[Discipline A Abilities| A.]] Detain
Once per round, when a creature attempts to moves out of your attack range, you may immediately make a single attack against them. On a successful hit, they remain in place and immediately end their movement.

### [[Discipline B Abilities| B.]] Battlefield Architect
You know how to build barricades, palisades, trenches and ramparts, even without specialized equipment. With the right materials and a team of hands, you can build such structures quickly. *Subject to GM negotiation.*

### [[Discipline B Abilities| B.]] Marching Orders
You are exceptionally well conditioned for marching in all sorts of terrain. Add fatigue for every two hexes traveled on foot, instead of each one.

### [[Discipline C Abilities| C.]] Heave-Ho!
Your throwing hand is unmatched. You automatically hit any target within 30’ when making a ranged attack with a javelin or spear.

### [[Discipline D Abilities| D.]] Court of Adversity
You stand alone with the same dignity as if you had a legion behind you. Carve a staff on vinewood for yourself, as a symbol of Saint Merrow. While you can see an ally who is Afraid, make all to-hit and damage rolls with advantage.
