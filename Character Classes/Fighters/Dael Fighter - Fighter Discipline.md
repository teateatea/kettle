### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] For Glory
  
Your speeches resound with the music of the skalds. At the beginning of combat, all allies (including you) who can hear you gain Ld4 HP if they follow you into battle *(where L is the number of levels you have taken in Swashbuckler)*.

If they are already at full HP, they instead gain +2 to-hit on their next Attack.

Your war cries resound with the music of the skalds. If you charge at the beginning of combat, gain Ld4 HP *(where L is the number of levels you have taken in Swashbuckler)*. If allies who can hear you follow you into battle, they also gain Ld4 HP .

If any creature that would gain HP this way is undamaged, they instead gain +2 to-hit on their next melee attack.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Boast
Your boasts and tales attract attention anywhere. Spread rumors and stories across an establishment with a successful CHA check.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Battle Cry
You inspire allies or terrify enemies with a vigorous shout. Once per combat, reroll an ally or enemy morale check and take your choice of the result.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Shield bash
A successful shield bash briefly knocks an enemy off balance. Until their next turn, they take -2 AC and you gain +2 AC against their attacks.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Song of Swords
~~You’re loud, but you’re not just some ruffian anymore.~~ Once per day, you can make swords sing. You and each ally may immediately make a melee attack, even if you or they have already attacked this round. If your allies cannot attack, they may instead move towards an enemy, even if they have already moved this round. 

For each ally that attacks due to this effect, you gain +1 AC until the end of your next round.
