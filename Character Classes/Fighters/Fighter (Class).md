### Attack Bonus
Unlike other classes, fighters do not have a fixed attack bonus at each level. Instead, their bonuses come from their **deed die**. During combat, the fighter adds their deed die as a bonus to both their attack rolls and their damage rolls. The deed die is only rolled once per combat round, even if the fighter attacks multiple times.

### Mighty Deed of Arms
Prior to any attack roll, a fighter can declare a **Deed**: a dramatic combat maneuver within the scope of the current combat. The Deed does not increase damage, but can have other combat effects, such as tripping, blinding, or pushing back an enemy, leaping onto enemies from balconies, etc.

The Fighter's **deed die** roll for this round determines the Deed's success. If the deed die is a **3 or higher**, and the attack hits, the Deed succeeds. If the deed die is a **2 or less**, or the overall attack fails, the Deed fails as well.

### Combat Instincts
Once per combat, the fighter may turn a missed attack they have made into a hit. Alternatively, they may turn a successful attack against them into a miss.

Combat instincts cannot be used for or against spells, nor can it be used if the attack could never hit, such as attacking something out of range.

### [[Disciplines - Fighter Class|Disciplines]]
Fighters choose a [[Disciplines - Fighter Class|discipline]] at 1st level, and gain relevant aspects and abilities based on their training. At each new level, they progress to the next step of the discipline *(first A, then B, C, D, etc)*.

Most Fighters are [[Village Hero - Fighter Discipline|Village Heroes]] *(see below)*, but other disciplines may be available. A fighter may study multiple disciplines, but only progresses in one discipline per level, and cannot skip steps in any discipline.
