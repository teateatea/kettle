### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Face the Challenge
When a creature attacks you, you may focus on the threat. You gain +L AC vs that creature *(where L is the number of levels you’ve taken in Village Hero)*, and -1 AC vs attacks from any other source.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Sentinel 
Once per round, when a creature moves into your attack range, you may immediately make a single attack against them.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Salt of the Earth
When talking with people from towns, villages, and other small communities, make reaction rolls with advantage.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Ring the Bell
Deal +1d6 damage against targets wearing plate or metal armour. Each successful hit reduces the targets AC by 1, and completely destroys their armor on the third hit.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Rally the People
Adjacent allies may use your deed die when they attack, instead of their attack bonus. Your deed die is still only rolled once per round, regardless of how many attacks are being made.
