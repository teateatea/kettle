### Attack Bonus
Unlike other Classes, Fighters do not have a fixed Attack Bonus at each Level. Instead, their Attack Bonus comes from their **Deed Die**.

During combat, the Fighter adds their Deed Die to both their Attack Rolls and their Damage Rolls. The Deed Die is only rolled once per Round, even if the Fighter attacks multiple times.

### Mighty Deed of Arms
Prior to any Attack Roll, the Fighter may declare a Mighty Deed of Arms, or a **Deed**, for short. A Deed is a dramatic combat maneuver within the scope of the current combat.

The Deed does not increase damage, but could have some other combat effect: pushing back an enemy, tripping or entangling them, temporarily blinding them, and so on.

The Fighter's Deed Die determines the Deed’s success. This is the same die used for the Fighter's Attack and Damage Bonus each Round. **If the Deed Die rolls 3 or higher, and the attack hits, the Deed succeeds.** If the Deed Die rolls a 2 or less, or the overall attack fails, the Deed fails as well.

### Combat Instincts
Once per combat, the Fighter may turn a missed attack they have made into a hit. Alternatively, they may turn a successful attack against them into a miss.

Combat instincts cannot be used for or against spells, nor can it be used if the attack could never hit, such as attacking something out of range.

### [[Disciplines - Fighter Class|Disciplines]]
Fighters choose a [[Disciplines - Fighter Class|Discipline]] at 1st level, and gain relevant aspects and abilities based on that training. Each time the Fighter gains a Level, they progress to the next step of their Discipline: First **A** then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.

Fighters may study multiple [[Disciplines - Fighter Class|Disciplines]], but only progress in one Discipline per Level, and cannot skip steps in any Discipline.
